Right from the day the promos of this film aired, I believed that the film is going to pitch in a surprise. And it does manage to pull in a surprise right from the word go. It also leaves a strong point which I have always mentioned that you never need a GREAT STARCAST to sell a film. All you need is a convincing story with convincing actors. And trust me VICKY DONOR promises to stick to both of these rules. It has Ayushmann Khurrana making his debut alongside Yami Gautam and the only powerful prominent star present is the versatile Annu Kapoor. Made at a modest budget of 5 crores (modest in terms of other grand Bollywood flicks) the film pitches in the biggest surprise of the year.
 
**Enter Ayushmann a.k.a Vicky Arora** who Chaddha finds apt for being a donor and his ticket to being rich. Vicky Arora is a typical Delhi lad who loves whiling away time doing nothing but shopping, playing cricket and clubbing. His **mother (Dolly Ahluwalia)** runs a beauty parlour and mints money which her son shamelessly spends.

What is brilliant about the film is that it is so light hearted and it tackles a sensitive issue of Sperm Donation with so much ease. Moments filled with laughter and equally strong drama make this a complete entertainer. Not at one single point the film gets preachy of the issue and continues to tickle your funny bone.
 
The film marks the debut of many people and not just John Abraham as producer. An entirely new crew of fresh bunch of young talent put up their efforts to give us a brilliant piece of work which leaves a strong message in the end.
 
**Annu Kapoor** we all know is a versatile actor and has proved his worth in any role, and this time too he delivers a noteworthy performance. His obsession with sperms and his dedication as Baldev Chaddha is a delight to watch on screen.
 
Though the comedy drama loses some steam in the latter parts, the writing stays impressive for most of the run, as beneath all the ample humor there lies a genuine heart. The impeccable comic timing of Ayushmann Khurrana and Annu Kapoor make it a non stop laughathon. A solid fun watch.
 
There is really no way to deal with a subject so taboo in Indian society without adding a fair bit of comedy into the mix, and *Vicky Donor* excels in that department. It's laugh-out-loud hilarious, offbeat, and features the always refreshing cadences of Delhi vernacular.
 
a well-made, progressive entertaining experiment that has also aged quite well. we need ayushmann khurrana back in delhi based romcoms, bro has nailed that genre among his contemporaries like no one else. yami had all the potential, but bollywood slept on her. also, paani daa has a sad version too?? wow. the album had that indie vibe that artists nowadays try hard to bring into their music but fail miserably. romance and comedy both click. shoojit sircar keeps inspiring with his cinema! ??
 
Sejauh ini aku belum pernah nonton film-filmnya Ayushmann yang jelek. Termasuk film ini. Pas pertama baca sinopsis film ini, aku langsung keingat *Delivery Man (2013),* film yang dibintangi Vince Vaughn. Sama-sama tentang pendonor sperma. Cuman setelah nonton, aku ngerasa film ini jauuuuuuuuuh lebih baik daripada *Delivery Man*. Lebih lucu, lebih rapi, dan lebih mengharukan.

Bayangin aja ada dokter kesuburan yang ngejar-ngejar nggak pantang menyerah ngajak buat gabung bisnis donor sperma. Bayangin aja kalau kegiatan merancap atau istilah akrabnya, ngocok, malah jadi pekerjaan tetap yang menghasilkan banyak uang. Bukannya jadi kegiatan buang-buang tisu belaka.
 
Ayushmann Khurrana is one of the top actors in the Bollywood industry. He has always been the actor who slays in every role and has a fanbase of millions. Khurrana has given many great performances and everyone just loves him. As the actor is turning a year older tomorrow, here's a list of his AMAZING performances one must watch.
 
In his debut film, the actor played a sperm donor. The film did extremely well at the box office and made him a rising star. Khurrana played the role of an unemployed Delhi boy who donates sperms for a living.
 
Andhadhun is a Hindi-language dark-humoured crime thriller film released in 2018. Directed by Sriram Raghavan, it is a film about deception, lies and manipulation. Ayushmann's performance gave goosebumps to literally everyone.
 
Badhaai Ho stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao, Surekha Sikri, Shardul Rana, and Sanya Malhotra. The film depicts the narrative of a middle-aged couple who become pregnant and no one is happy with it.
 
Ayushmann Khurrana portrays an actor whose female voice mimicry attracts unwanted attention from crazy men. The film also stars Nushrratt Bharuccha in the lead role. It did pretty well at the box office and one MUST watch it at least once.
 
Narrating a unique story between two extremely offbeat characters, Gulabo Sitabo, directed by Shoojit Sircar, is one of the very first films to debut directly to digital during this ongoing pandemic era.
