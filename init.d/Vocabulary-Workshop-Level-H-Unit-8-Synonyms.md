TDWG picked up activities of externalgroups providing unit-level (specimen, observation) data standards, includingthose for botanical garden records (ITF) and herbaria (HISPID). Thesedevelopments were paralleled by the creation of relational information models (ASC 1992, CDEFD 1995, BioCISE1998, etc., see standards page) serving as reference models for databaseand standard development. During the TDWG meeting in 2000 (Frankfurt), the needfor an XML standard data definition was generally accepted. Early in 2001 thegroup was assigned Working Group status by CODATA (2002 this was upgraded toTask Group status).
 
ABCD was devised as acomprehensive XML schema, providing maximum capacity to expose data containedin unit-level collection databases. Apart from the definition of XML tags andstructures, it was an explicit aim to define the semantics of all elements,thus providing a basic ontology for the domain. The schema is extendible tosupport special requirements of specific communities.

ABCD is to provide acommon data definition for all biological collections (living, dead, sets ofobservations, sounds, etc.) and it is to include full support for statements ofprovider rights, IPR, copyright etc. It allows variable atomisation, i.e.polymorphic content (e.g. names as one string or fully atomised) to support awide range of provider database structures. In general, it does not take aminimal common denominator approach but supports rich data, thus looking beyondthe obvious questions users have regarding information content of biologicalcollections.
 
The ENHSIN and BioCASEprojects drove the process 2001/2002, providing drafts that were discussedduring TDWG and other meetings and which were exposed in a Request for Commentprocess. An editorial meeting sponsored by GBIF led to the version currentlyused in reference implementations. In 2002 the ABCD Schema was accepted byGBIF, but GBIF was going ahead with DiGIR and Darwin Core (DC) because providerand portal software was available for DiGIR, and that protocol was not able tohandle complex schemas such as ABCD. A protocol supporting ABCD was provided bythe BioCASE reference implementation in 2003, and in October, GBIF decided tointegrate the BioCASE network into the nascent GBIF network. The current version(and version history) of ABCD is availble under
 
The**very broad coverage** leaves it tothe consumer to determine where to look. However, it looks far too complicatedfor the average user and thus will not normally be exposed. It is up to theprogrammer to reassemble the different uses of the structure into a **presentationlayer** that supports user requirements. A reference portal implementation isunder construction by the Paris� BioCASE team, the Berlin team has implementedpreliminary interfaces as an intermediate measure (see ).
 
As an **effect ofpolymorphism**, the challenge with ABCD from a client application developer�sperspective is that the data can be in different places. BioCASE developershave to do some tricks such as concatenating data to present the data. Theyneed **more documentation**.
 
Does ABCD support**phylocode and ranklessnaming**? ABCD does not cover taxonomic data (synonyms etc.), it covers namesas the result of the identification of a unit (a specimen or the observation ofan organism in the field). ABCD does not currently support structured names followingthe phylocode, they would have to be entered as an informal name in the current schema. If thereis a need for a structured response, we can the schema can be extended withoutaffecting the over-all structure.

Another aspect of **polymorphism**is the efficiency for **importing data**. For example, the AustralianVirtual Herbarium interrogates the network to find if a duplicate record isavailable and, if so, imports it. Polymorphism may be in the way of this.However, it also may help because people are not forced to de-atomize theirdata; moreover, there is no obstacle for groups of data providers to agree oncertain elements to be mandatory for information exchange.
 
**Should the name be mandatory? And whichone?**Scientific names arecurrently supported on three levels of atomisation: as a single string, as twostrings (name and author/year, to align with Darwin Core), and fully atomised.In addition, informal names such as common names are supported as the result ofan identification event. None of these are mandatory. ABCD supports theprovision of unit data without identification, because researchers may behighly interested in unidentified material from a defined location.
 
After some discussionof alternative structures, it was agreed that � if a scientific name isprovided � the simplest taxon string should be made mandatory, even if moreatomised data is present. This element can be concatenated in a view on the levelof the provider database und it be used for searches. Common name should not beincluded except as an anomaly.
 
This implies torearrange the identification type so that the NameAuthorYearString becomesmandatory whenever there is a scientific name selected as the result of anidentification. The name of this element led to the misconception that it mustinclude all these items. This is not the case and the name should reflect that.At least a comment must clarify that this can be anything from a single genusname (or �Genus sp.� etc.) to a full botanical name (incl. basionym andcombination author teams) or a full zoological name (including year ofpublication).
 
It must also be madeclear if scientific names of a rank higher than genus can be inserted here(e.g. family name). It may be necessary to allow that because it reflectscurrent use in many databases (e.g. the identification of an not furtherspecified invertebrate in a vertebrate collection). The higher taxon elementsprovided by the schema are used to classify the identification result, whensuch a classification is present in the source database. They can be used tosimplify searches and provide metadata, but perhaps should not represent theactual result of the identification.
 
But what to do if theprovider does not distinguish between common and scientific name and has a mix?This would be solved by the inclusion of all these identification results underinformal names � and a strong recommendation to change the database to make itmore useful for scientific purposes.
 
In a collectioninformation system, cases where users want to search common names andscientific names in one go appear to be rare, if this is to be allowed, it canbe taken care of at the portal level.
 
It is not the purposeof the collection schema to provide a place to put all taxonomic data that maybe present in a source database. For example, synonymic searches should beusing a Names Service to expand the query.�
 
There clearly is a **needfor more guidance** to configuration, recommendations how to map elements,preferred points for searches, what to do if an element is empty, etc. GBIFcurrently supports a project to produce a generic interface to map betweendatabase schemas and federation schemas such as ABCD. An effort should be madeto provide a fully commented version or rather a documentation of the semanticsof ABCD schema.
 
Controlledvocabularies or authority files used as such would greatly enhance theusability of the data for data mining applications etc. Controlled vocabulariesshould only be used where there is a controlled list of values that does notdepend on language or (scientific) opinion. Different communities could agreeon different areas of the schema where controlled vocabularies are useful,however, these then cannot be enforced by the XML schema. Requiring the use ofcontrolled vocabularies means requiring databases to adhere to it, which atpresent would be a major obstacle in the global effort to mobilise content. Weshould be influencing the community with best practices of how the capture datain the future. Best practices have to be documented, e.g. recommendationsshould be given to use fully descriptive values instead of abbreviations evenif in a foreign language.
 
A specific question tobe addressed is that of **taxonomic ranks for higher taxa**. In Darwin Core(DC), there are elements for the names of different ranks (but not all ranksare defined). In ABCD, there is a single unbounded element with an attributerank. To be able to convert ABCD data into DC, a controlled vocabulary shouldbe provided for that attribute in ABCD. However, if we make it a controlledvocabulary, we are proscriptive. The solution decided upon was to provide a controlled vocabulary of rank names but to leave theattribute as optional. That is,taxa can be entered without rank.
 
Some of the complex types used in ABCDcould become part of other standards, thus helping to build a repository of XMLdata types for biodiversity data. Consensus was that we can agree on complex types that arerelatively simple � like datetime, coordinates, etc. Where possible, typesdefined by other communities should be used. Links to geographic standards arediscussed within the Spatial Data Subgroup. GML (Geographic Markup Language)types can be used to extend the present ABCD schema.
 
**DateTimeType** � we need to add an Explicit field.� The value of Yes would indicate that theevent occurred over the range of time indicated.� The value of No for Explicit would indicate the event occurredsometime during the range of time.
 
**Identification /Name types** � Reusability ofthese in the Descriptive Data standard and in the forthcoming Names andConcepts standard must be discussed. Where possible, these standards should atleast use the same element d
