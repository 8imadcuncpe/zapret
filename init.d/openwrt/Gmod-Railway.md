NOT a train enthusiast here, I'd just really like to know what it is you train enthusiasts find so interesting about trains. It's insane how many people I've met both online and in the real world who have a genuine interest in trains, and while I can fully understand the appeal of automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, spacecraft and watercraft, I genuinely can't comprehend why or how a train could be so fascinating when it's essentially a gigantic truck with lots of tiny metal wheels, so please, someone enlighten me on this subject.

Well, I'm more of a model train enthusiast than I am of actual trains. I love their miniature craftsmanship, and the absolute worlds people can create with them. On the subject of trains as a whole though, I love all the moving parts, the thousands of tons of freight lumbering by, carrying cargo all over the nation, and the distant horn blasts as I fall asleep.
 
The thing I love the most though is taking a long-distance passenger train. Seeing all the scenery of the United States with no traffic to annoy me, with no jetlag to kill me, and enjoying a very comfortable ride in a sleeper cabin with very good food 3 times a day really appeals to me. I took the Amtrak "Auto Train" from Lorton VA to Sanford Florida, and the food was excellent, (I'm talking beef brisket and atlantic cod) I slept well, and I saw the sights of the east coast all while my car sat a few cars behind me. All in all a 28 hour trip that only cost about $100 more than a car ride down. (With wear & tear, gas, etc.)

Well, I bought it. Wanted to get in for the early access price, and it looks pretty playable as is, so.... Just gotta get my gaming rig repaired... And since it doesn't require VR anymore, that's a plus.
 
Not since I was 10. Worked on my grandfather's HO garage layout a bit in the 60's). I sometimes build N scale models. I've got my eyes on 3D printers though...maybe one of these days I might build a layout maybe even make my own dcc system (good excuse to brush up my assembly language skills).
 
**First** there is a little something i just got printed/built/painted...well, minus the railings. It took ages to print, and was a bit of a pain to assemble in a few places, but it was SO worth it in the end .
 
The lovely 1:32 scale SW-1500 by Daniel Noree, with Flexicoil trucks by raby and custom stickers and cab interior by me. It's part of the Open Railway project. You can find it on Thingiverse and My Mini Factory, and propably other places as-well.
 
Like raby, i decided to go for Nasa color's on my SW-1500. It was used by Nasa to pull the SRB transport train, that as the name might suggest, was used to transport recoverd Solid Rocket Boosters by rail in 6 segments (nose, engine and 4 fuel-tanks) on 5 specialized 8-axle flatcars. The train would usually also have a couple spacer-cars (empty flat-cars) on front, a clearance-car behind them (a standard box-car with roll-bar thingy's on it) and box-cars between every special flat-car.
 
**Secondly**, i would suggest you check out OS-railway on thingiverse. The project contains a bunch of locomotives that are meant to be motorized and fitted with an ARDUINO thingy to control the thing with your phone or something.
 
**Oh, and thirdly**, if you're planning on designing your own stuff, i highly suggest Fusion 360, it's professional and it's free if you fill the criteria (details on the website. Can be a bit hard to find, but it's there).
 
If you guys are wondering about the current state of my main layout, it's currently still in winter storage. I could probably set it up right now if i wanted to, but since i will likely be moving away soon, i don't want to go trough the trouble of putting it up and possibly having to tear it down like 2 weeks later.
 
A bit of a sad story, but anyway; last week we moved about 150 locos and about as many wagons from storage. The owner decided to sell them since his illness is preventing him from enjoying them. We are still going through them, cataloging them, figuring out prices etc. Most of it is in good or decent condition, some brand new. Some are not in their own boxes so it's a bit of a mess. It took us two days to move it all out and we filled a Peugeot 5008 twice.
 
Well, Finally got around to playing with Derail Valley. It's pretty cool. The controls for non VR are a little weird at first, but you do get used to them rather quickly. I did end up running around the station house with a coffee mug in my hand that I couldn't get rid of, since all the instructions and everything are actual objects in the game, and I didn't have room for anything else, I couldn't drop the mug to pick up the instructions again to see how to drop the mug.
 
Game play is really nice. I have a semi-potato laptop, and I don't think I can run anything else in the background while this is running (like I can with KSP), but once it loads up (another boot the game and go make a meal situation), it's really smooth. Slightly choppy for me at default gfx settings, but once I toned them done, very smooth.
 
Once you get used to the interface, it's really easy to play. I only played a couple of the shunting jobs around a yard, but it was really fun. The open world setup of the cab and environment makes the immersion really cool. The movement controls (while walking) are a little weird, you can easily end up on top of a building by accident (while you can walk, it's much easier to teleport to your mouse cursor, and if you don't aim correctly....).
 
A lovely piece of model-railroading history, a really really old Mrklin train-set. I don't know the exact age of this thing, but stuff like "Made in West Germany", the metal track-bed, all metal train-cars and a single large ski type pickup system should give you a better idea.
 
Because of the age of this thing, im already planning on 3D-printing a display case for this so that i can keep it in good clean condition for years to come, just need to experiment a bit with the clear filament i got and see that just how clear it actually is.
 
In the simulator side of things, one "train-simulator" that ive found surprisingly fun is Garrysmod. Using mods like Sligwolfs train stuff and the CBH trains stuff, and using the proper maps like, the Sunset gulch, you can have quite a bit of fun.
 
It's not that old. That set was produced from 1972 until 1978. The M track appears to be in nice enough condition, and if it works flawlessly as you say, it must have been taken care of. Usually, with time, M track develops nasty rust that makes operation jerky until the track is thoroughly cleaned. The trafo also looks to be in decent condition.
 
If you want to buy more M track, it can be purchased rather cheaply on flea markets, but you should only buy stuff in perfect condition. If you do plan on extending that Marklin layout, I'd suggest you do it with C track. It's much better. There are transitional segments between M and C, so you can still use the track you have.
 
The design is a common standard used for many railway buildings at that time. Built with 5 LOD levels, from about 50k polys down to less than 1k. In addition to some smaller materials, the whole asset is based on two trim sheets, a 4K and a 2048x1024 one and it was quite a challenge to try to make everything into those without visually hurting repetitions.
 
The brick and the concrete textures both use only one material, both created by me from scratch using Substance Designer. The reason the design an own brick material was that these old bricks walls feature a lot of colors from light grey thru red to almost black, with at least 4-5 significant tones, while certain parts of the walls have been painted over with some rude red and look completely monotonic. Includes seasonal support and night mode illumination.
 
The **Brighton and Rottingdean Seashore Electric Railway** was a unique coastline railway in Brighton, England, that ran through the shallow coastal waters of the English Channel between 1896 and 1901.[1] It was designed by Magnus Volk to extend his Volk's Electric Railway from its terminus in Paston Place to the village of Rottingdean and avoid difficult terrain. While the unique railway was popular and carried tens of thousands of passengers, it was ultimately abandoned to make room for new sea defences, and Volk was unable to raise the funds to construct a replacement.
 
Magnus Volk, its owner, designer and engineer, had already been successful with the more conventional Volk's Electric Railway, which had then not been extended east of Paston Place. With unfavourable geography in that area, Volk decided to construct a line through the surf from a pier at Paston Place to one at Rottingdean. This was also home to Volk's Seaplane Station which was used by his son George Herbert Volk.
 
Construction took two years from 1894 to 1896. The railway officially opened on 28 November 1896, but was nearly destroyed by a storm the night of 4 December. Volk immediately began rebuilding the railway, including the *Pioneer*, which had been knocked on its side. *Pioneer* was salvaged and brought ashore, and rebuilt with the legs two feet higher than the previous design. After repairs to *Pioneer* and the railway were complete, service resumed on 20 July 1897.[5] By the end of that year, 44,282 passengers had travelled on Volk's "Sea Voyage on Wheels".[5]
