Hey everyone, just finished a rough draft of the character Mako from avatar the last airbender (legend of korra). Hes low poly with no sub surf modifiers so looking a bit blocky right now. I plan to make a high poly version and sculpt in a bunch of detail if mudbox will allow it haha. Heres the concept image I worked from,
 
a few things I need to change are some proportions and the overall form of the clothing. any suggestions or critiques would be helpful, just keep in mind a good bit of work is left before I rig and pose, thanks for viewing!
 
hey thanks for the tips man, I shrunk his head and it looks a lot better (more anime style) and flattened out his eye brows a bit. Im probably gonna sculpt the head for all the details and redo the hair as well to get a more organic feel, his face is mostly placeholders right now for shape/form.
 
quick update, rigged the character and cleaned some things up, also tweaked a few proportions. Gave the scene some better lighting too. I think it looks pretty good despite the lack of polygons haha, any more critiques would be appreciated before I animate a turntable and call the model complete! Thanks for viewing
 
Thanks a lot man, this was a fun one to build! Heres a turntable I put together so you can see the entire form, I need to fix some weight painting in certain areas (gloves, shoulders) but im pretty happy with the result. time spent in total was just under 4 hours.

70 years have passed since Avatar Aang defeated Fire Lord Ozai and ended the Hundred Year War. Aang has since passed away and was reborn as Korra, a girl from the Southern Water Tribe. At the age of seventeen, Korra has mastered three of the four elements and must now move on to Republic City to master airbending. However, the city is full of crime and in the middle of an anti-bender revolution. Led by Amon, the Equalists seek to remove all benders from the world.
 
Six months after the end of the Equalist revolution, Korra has become a fully-realized avatar. Since then, incidents with dark spirits have arisen and Korra has become the student of her spiritual uncle Unalaq who is the chief of the Northern Water Tribe. Meanwhile, tensions are rising between the two Water Tribes and a civil war is in danger of starting.
 
Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence, a change in the world's energy has occurred due to that event and Korra leaving the portals to the Spirit World open. As a result, more airbenders have emerged throughout the world. While Korra is helping rebuild the new Air Nation, a man named Zaheer who is one of the new airbenders uses his abilities to escape from prison. After helping his friends escape from prison, Zaheer seeks to rid the world of the Order of the White Lotus, all governments, and the Avatar.
 
Three years later, Korra is recovering from a serious injury while Kuvira is helping the Earth Kingdom recover from a state of anarchy and chaos. However, while she was supposed to relinquish her power to the crowned prince Wu, she instead forms the Earth Empire and declares herself the new ruler. Kuvira ends up becoming a tyrant and sends all who oppose her to reeducation camps. After recovering from her physical injuries, Korra must once again jump back into action to stop this dictator while still dealing with PTSD as the result of her near-death experience.
 
*The Legend of Korra* has a large fandom. Early fan interest was high and this caused the series to be extended beyond its original intended run of twelve episodes. On a Tumblr post, it was revealed that the Legend of Korra was the animated TV series with the largest amount of reblogs. After the series ended on December 19, 2014, a poll was conducted on IGN where the Legend of Korra was voted the most missed show that ended in 2014, beating How I Met Your Mother by over 20%.
 
Shipping wars have been known to get quite heated among the *Legend of Korra* fandom. In Book One: Air, the shipping wars were primarily between the Makorra and Masami shippers, with Borra also being heavily involved. However, by the end of Book 1, a lot of fans started to ship Korrasami. From that point on, the shipping war was primarily between Makorra and Korrasami. With Korrasami becoming canon in the series finale, many fans have celebrated, while others are unhappy and claim that the pairing had no romantic development.
