Ive linked my account to the headset but none of my files are showing even though they are supported file types. i asked oculus and was told to ask here because they said it wasnt an issue with the headset but with the service.

Mods can go ahead and delete/lock this thread...i found a workaround for it...problem was i dont have (and dont plan to have) a PC so i couldnt just plug it in and transfer but i just used my xbox to upload from the external drive the videos where on, downloaded them on to my tablet from there, reformatted them, then uploaded to google from tablet and downloaded them on to the headset from there...took a bit of time but it works
 
Setting up the Dropbox app on a virtual machine or desktop or sync virtual machine program files could work however, we cannot really indicate whether it would work fully as expected, considering each third party VR software, may have unexpected configurations.

Yes me too i have the same problem. It appeared after the last Oculus Quest Update V12.
So it is an Oculus Problem and there are People already posting in the Oculus comunity support section. I hope Oculus will see it and can fix it soon, because Dropbox is one of the few ways to easily transfer files..(in my case 3D stereoscopic Pictures and Videos) to this device and into the Oculus Gallery.

I finally would like to add that I have managed to get good fps twice, for some unknown reason, but if I touched any option in the fps menus I would go back to 5fps.
I am using Steam to open my game and the game launches with Steam VR but uses Open XR (I did the Regedit thing).
 
UPDATE: It works perfectly fps wise with Virtual Desktop, so the problem is with the link (I have both the official and an amazon link cable).
The issue with virtual desktop is you cannot get the same clarity as with the link cable by overriding the resolution on the oculus app.
 
Thank you a lot man, unfortunately I had already read your very detailed post, I tried following the steps but I was unfortunately unsuccesful.
I will though try to do it again and check in the task manager what is happening with my components usage and get back to you, there has to be something that is causing the fps drop through the link cable, I just cannot find what D:
 
Thank you a lot for your reply! One question, I read a lot of people saying you can ditch SteamVR, but you always have to launch it if you own the game in steam in order to use VR right?
Or am I getting that wrong? Is there any other way to use VR without launching the app of steamvr? If so, could you please tell me the steps I should follow?
 
I built my PC last week, installed windows and updated drivers etc.
I downloaded Steam
I downloaded Oculus desktop App
I installed FS2020 from Steam
I followed these instructions as per the official FS Zendesk:
 
Yes you can @CroppingPoem113 , I will try doing it before I format, just one more question since I do not want to bother you both any further, are these the same settings you have in your SteamVR menu? @Mobias7
 
I do have it, oh so you can get rid of it entirely?? Wait, that means I have been doing something wrong, I will try to launch the game directly through the headset without using steam and get back to you in a minute.
I do have the oculus tray tool but I have not used it yet!
