The issue is I had to change the settings of my networtk to resolve an issue with some hardware I was using. Now I cannot get it back. Therefore I have no internet connection. I ahd disk with oeprating system at one time but cannot find it now. Was hoping to download from HP but, it says nothing is available. Any ideas on how I can get a recovery disk for my laptop?

I have just recently got a HP Pavilion dv6-1315tx computer second hand. It comes with Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed. The first thing I wanted to do was to create a recovery disk,but it seems as if the previous owner has already created a set. I am from Sri Lanka so I cannot order a Recovery Kit from HP. Their support page is confusing.
 
After doing a lot of research, I deleted files such as hpdrcu.dat from the recovery partition as well as another location. I also searched for Rebecca.dat but to no avail on my whole system, but still it gives the same error.
 
I had an issue with my laptop so I sent it to customer services for repair, and today trying to make a recovery disc it tells me that just one disc creation is allowed, which means they did this on the repair maybe.
 
**Edit**  
If the recovery cd is now unlocked but burning it hangs, then most probably your recovery partition is dead (note: one dvd is not enough, so I hope it's not simply waiting for the 2nd one!).  
From this article : HP Recovery Partition Low Disk Space (for XP), I understand that HP will update the recovery partition, and may destroy it if the allocated disk space for the partition is not enough to contain all Windows Updates.  
If that's the case, then your only hope AFAIK is to get a new restore cd elsewhere than from your own machine, either from the above listed sources, or download one from Windows Vista Recovery Disc Download (I have no first-hand knowledge regarding this source, and you need bit-torrent software for it, but it's much referenced on google).
 
There is no way I know of. (On Dell laptops there used to be a trick involving renaming a file that got created in system32 when you did your recovery CD. But I don't think this works anymore and it certainly can't be applied to HP because they use a different mechanism; an hidden partition). But there are a couple other possibilities.

Do note however that my answer doesn't even pretend to be definitive. The HP recovery partition is a mystery to me since I don't own, or never did, a Dell laptop. It's possible that you may get a more valid answer involving this partition, although unfortunately for you I do have my doubts because there is no reason for it to contain a complete image of the system. I sure hope I'm wrong :)
 
**HDD Image Backup**
Make backups of important files in your computer and uninstall all software bringing it back to a post-installation condition. You may also want to use programs like CCleaner and registry cleaners to organize things a bit.
 
**Manual System Installation**
If you already own a windows copy, just do my favorite option. Get all drivers and other software for your laptop model from HP downloads area and build a new XP installation disk with a tool like nLite.
 
I have new HP Pavlion dv6-2005ax.hpcd.sys not working because that changed to hpdrcu.prc,search and delete all hpdrcu.prc file. It is worked well for me.I want to creacte another recovery disc. because ordered recovery disc is not as same as that recovery disc created from my computer. hp ordered recovery disc take more time to recover the OS than my recovery disc.
 
I purchased a HP Pavilion dv6 notebook having Win 7 home premium installed. It had 3 system partions and and a C:\ drive. I made another partion and changed the drive letters of existing partions. After using this system for few months there are some issues with it and I want to go back to factory settings. I tried but could not recover my system. I dont have recovery disks for my system. Kindly guide me how can recover my system to preconfigured state. From where I can download recovery disks for my laptop?
 
**1.Right-click on "Computer" icon and select manage.
2.This will launch the Microsoft Management Console.
3.On the left side of the MMC, click on "Disk Management" and it will show you all of the partitions.
4.Right-click on the "HP Recovery" partition and select "Mark as Active Partition."
5.When the warning prompt appears, select "Yes" - Reboot and it will automatically boot into the Recovery Manager (without pressing F11).**
 
Since HP wants to nickel and dime people for these disks, can someone send them to me, or let me know if they can be downloaded from anywhere??? And, I say nickel and dime because these should have been included with the laptop or if the recovery partition is corrupt, they should be offered for free since we went and bought the product, the least they can do is support it. The computer is a year old, and they can't service it or provide any thing other than purchasing the disks. Which I think is BS, but that's my humble opinion.
 
I have just bought a new HP Pavilion **dv6-2150ee** and when I tried to burn the recovery discs I received an error message: **"A set of recovery discs was previously created for this computer. Only one set is allowed for each computer"**, although I haven't created them before .
 
To burn another set of recovery discs I searched the internet and came up with editing\deleting the file "hpcd.sys" in both the recovery partition and in c:\Windows\SMINST\ folder, unfortunately I didn't find this files in either locations .
 
The main brands have a special quirk for such things. (making crappy recovery partitions, providing not recovery media, providing not install media), HP is reknown for this and has already been sued (and lost) for this behaviour:
 
you are supposed to get a "good quality" 16 Gb USB flash stick and put it in a safe place and never use it only to hold the stupid backup they fail to provide in order to save a few cents in manufacturer's supplied DVD's:
 
About the alternative method using 16 GB USB flash stick, I tried this method and unfortunately I have got an error message "the recovery media for your system has been created before. please press cancel to exit the program".
 
Sorry to beat your (sadly) dead horse, but you may notice how even "attempting" (which should imply "without succeeding") to create the media seems like triggering the "already made" flag or whatever that prevents you to create the recovery disk now .
 
I do understand how difficult is the work of the support guys, , but very often you find people that think you are calling them because you are a whiner and a lier (instead of one of their customers which payed a non-trivial amount of money to buy one of their firm products and are in deep trouble because they made a crappy decision to shave off what, US$ 3.00, from the value of the thingy you bought ) and that you are somehow attempting to \*steal\* something from them.
 
As all of us who have or do work for large corporations know, sometimes they do the dumbest things to save a buck (and end up probably not saving much in the process anyway). For every good idea, there are likely any number of dumb ones that don't work.
 
(You may also want to notice how the example dialog in the above shows that there is a drop down box for Quantity, which in plain English means that you can only create your recovery CD/DVD's once, but you can buy more than one copy with the same serial ).
 
Now, let's say that out of the 18,700 sales 1/3 is "Corporate" and will use their ways or have an IT to manage the PC's, 1/3 are home/office users that will manage to create the discs without problems, 1/4 won't care or will find another way and will never be heard.
 
However, this way they get 1,500 angry customers each year, which (unless they are complete morons) will tell all their friends and relatives how crappy it was the method chosen, which is not unlikely that will double the number of people that next year (or two years after) could have become HP Customers and will instead choose another brand because of this "accident", thus losing maybe 3,000 possible customers of their new notebook.
 
No, and I'm all for giving users tools to help them troubleshoot (if possible) and avoid the service calls, because a few dollars up front is much easier to budget for than an unknown number of dollars later. Plus, people are expensive, but a user's time (speaking as the OEM) is not - give them media and instructions on how to use it, and I'd bet it'd be a good-will gesture and a money saver overall.
 
To **jaclaz**, . Yes I know it's stupid thing to do something you know it will not success but when you have no hope to solve a problem, you may do the thing twice hoping to succeed in the second try, In my case one of the guesses is that may be a problem with the recovery Disc creation program, so may it works with HP USB Recovery Flash Disk Utility anyway it doesn't work I mean **Unfortunately hahahahahaha** =)) .
 
Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) is a recovery environment that can repair common causes of unbootable operating systems. WinRE is based on Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE), and can be customized with additional drivers, languages, Windows PE Optional Components, and other troubleshooting and diagnostic tools. By default, WinRE is preloaded into the Windows 10 and Windows 11 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) and Windows Server 2016, and later, installations.
 
After any of these actions is performed, all user sessions are signed off and the **Advanced startup** menu is displayed. If your users select a WinRE feature from this menu,
