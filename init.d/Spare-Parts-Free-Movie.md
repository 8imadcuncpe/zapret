In 2004, four Mexican students arrive at the Marine Advanced Technology Education Robotics Competition at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB); born in Mexico, raised in Phoenix, Arizona, where they attend an underfunded public high school.
 
Oscar Vazquez goes to an Armed Forces Career Center to enlist into the U.S. Army; while he is waiting for his interview, he sees a video announcement and brochures about a Marine Underwater Robotics Competition, an event sponsored by NASA and the United States Armed Forces. Although he distinguishes himself as part of the Carl Hayden High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, he is forbidden to join because of his status as an illegal immigrant; he is recommended not to present himself to any government office to avoid being reported to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Vazquez lies to his mother about his progress in the Army; looking for another way to move ahead in life, he investigates the Underwater Robotics Competition.

With no previous formal teaching experience and between jobs, Fredi Cameron interviews for a vacant substitute teacher position at Carl Hayden High School. The principal questions his job stability record, but eventually hires Cameron because of his PhD and engineer credentials. After the interview, while in the school's parking lot, Lorenzo Santillan overrides Cameron's car temperature safety sensor for $20 to avoid a more costly repair job.
 
As part of his normal teaching responsibilities, Cameron is assigned to oversee an engineering club, where he meets Vazquez, who is looking for help to build a remotely operated underwater robot for the UCSB robotics competition. Cameron grudgingly accepts to help, even though he doesn't feel he is going to remain at the school for long.
 
Vazquez, looking for more kids to join the engineering club, talks to teacher Gwen Kolinsky, who recommends Cristian Arcega. After agreeing to help, Arcega takes the technical lead of the project and sketches an early design of the potential robot. Before starting to build it, Cameron suggests a prototype so they can do a proof of concept model.
 
Cameron starts to learn about the competition rules and requirements, which demands the robot to successfully complete a series of underwater tasks. Kolinsky offers to help teaching him about the PBASIC programming language, to implement the robot's intelligence module.
 
After catching Santillan stealing from the principal's car, Cameron forces him to join the team and the now named Robotics Academic Club, so he can help with the mechanical design and building of the prototype. They later recruit Luis Aranda, for being strong enough to help lift the machine in and out of the pool.
 
Because of a lack of funds to see the project through, the team starts looking for spare parts and asking for donations from the local businesses, which raise $663.53, plus $134.63 given by Cameron himself. The small budget forces them to scale back the original design and to innovate in how the robot is constructed, including the glue which gives the robot its name, "Stinky".
 
Needing to go from Phoenix to Santa Barbara creates problems because three of the four boys were illegal immigrants from Mexico. The day before the competition, they have to fix a critical electrical problem, due to a leak in the case that protected the intelligence module, by using tampons to contain the water.
 
They face several highly funded college teams; the team from MIT is backed by a $10,000 grant from ExxonMobil. The Phoenix teenagers scraped together less than $1,000 and built their robot out of scavenged parts. Yet their robot finishes the practical segment of the competition in fourth place with 75 points after missing three tasks. They are still hopeful for a chance to make it into third place because 30% of the total score would be based on the judges' technical evaluation and interview of the teams.
 
The night of the awards ceremony, they are given a Special Achievement award, which the team assumes is their final result. They are later surprised when they are announced as the champions of the event.
 
*Spare Parts* is an international co-production between The United States and Mexico, the first production under Lopez's film and TV deal with Pantelion Films and South Shore, the film and TV venture between Lionsgate and Mexican media giant Televisa.[6][7] Much of the shooting of the film was done on location in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[8]
 
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 56% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "*Spare Parts* is effective enough to do in a pinch for inspirational sports drama fans - although most of them will have seen these story beats hit more powerfully before."[9] According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 15 critics, the film received "mixed or average reviews".[10]
 
Although *Spare Parts* was based on real life events surrounding the formation and competition of a group of high school kids, there were creative liberties taken by the filmmakers in order to complete the story.
 
As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for many of the legacy brands that built the board and paper industry, we offer a wide selection of high-quality spare parts for machines manufactured by Valmet and its various predecessors.
 
With a deep history rooted in legacy brands like Beloit, Black-Clawson Kennedy, Tampella and PMP, you can rely on a holistic view of expertise in board and paper technology from the wet end to the dry end of your equipment.
 
The Valmet daily spares concept includes a full range of engineered parts, upgraded retrofit parts, and replacement and commercial parts. All daily spares are designed and manufactured in line with very strict quality requirements for board and paper machines.
 
The spare part packages include the spare parts crucial for a trouble-free, smooth start-up. A spare part package can be seen as insurance: the more comprehensive the spare package, the smaller the risk of a failed machine start-up due to a lack of spares.
 
Ensure safety and minimize downtime and risks like material shortage with our proactive shutdown planning services. Be sure you know the spare part needs related to maintenance shutdowns and reduce the workload of work planners and your supply chain resources.
 
The Department of Defense's (DOD) F-35 Joint Program Office does not oversee or account for spare parts in its global spares pool that have been accepted and received by the government and are located at non-prime contractor facilities. The F-35 Joint Program Office does not track or enter these spare parts into an accountable property system of record that would enable it to capture and store real-time changes to property records. Currently, the prime contractors maintain this information.
 
One contributing factor to DOD's lack of accountability over these spare parts is the lack of agreement among various organizations as to whether the spare parts are both accountable under a contract and government-furnished property. If the spare parts, which include engines; tires; landing gear; and other parts, such as bolts, screws, and fasteners, are not accountable under a contract and are not government-furnished property, the contractor will not enter these parts into the system DOD uses to track losses and disposition. Without DOD taking steps to ensure that these spare parts are accountable under a contract, the F-35 Joint Program Office will be unable to either gain or maintain accountability over these spare parts and will not have data, such as locations, costs, and quantities, needed for financial reporting or to ensure that government interests are protected.
 
The organizations' inability to reach consensus has also affected the F-35 Joint Program Office's processing of losses (spare parts that are lost, damaged, or destroyed) and disposition of spare parts in the global spares pool. Because the F-35 Joint Program Office does not maintain complete records on losses and disposition of spare parts, GAO used a combination of data provided by both the F-35 Joint Program Office and one prime contractor and found the following:
 
Without developing procedures for contractors to both (1) report global spares pool losses and (2) dispose of spare parts that staff have determined are excess, obsolete, or unserviceable, DOD does not have assurance that lost spare parts or those in need of disposition are being accurately reported and tracked. This increases the risk of misstatement on DOD's financial statements and increases the risk of mismanagement of F-35 global spares pool losses. It also potentially raises government expenditures.
 
The F-35 Lightning II aircraft is DOD's most costly weapon system in history. Overall costs are estimated to be more than $1.7 trillion over the program's life cycle. The F-35's supply chain has a unique design. Rather than owning the spare parts for their aircraft, the program participants share a common, global pool of spare parts that DOD owns and the prime contractors manage. These spare parts are held in over 50 domestic and international non-prime contractor facilities.
