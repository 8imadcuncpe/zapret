The PML-16 detectors record simultaneously in 16 separate channels of a multi-anode PMT. Simultaneous recording is achieved by bh's 'routing technique. The technique is based on the assumption that the detection of several photons in different detector channels within the response time of the TCSPC electronics is unlikely. Therefore, it is possible to combine the single-photon pulses of all detector channels in one photon-pulse line, generate a digital 'routing' signal that relates the individual photons to the detector channels, and record photons of different routing information into separate memory blocks in the TCSPC module. Please see Multi-Dimensional TCSPC on this web site or The bh TCSPC Handbook, chapter 'Multi-Dimensional TCSPC Implementations'. The operation of the PML-16 detectors in combination with the SPC module is illustrated in the figure below. The combined photon pulses of the PMT channels are used as a start signal for the photon timing. The number of the PMT channel that detected the photon is used as a routing signal. Consequently, the SPC module records a photon distribution over the times of the photons after the laser pulses and the channel number in the PMT. It is equivalent to 16 curves for the 16 channels of the PMT. Please note that the process does not involve any multiplexing or wavelength scanning. Every photon is just rcorded into a time channel according to its time in the laser pulse period, and the PMT channel at which it arrived. Therefore, the process works at near-ideal photon efficiency. For spectrally resolved detection with the PML-16 please see Multi-Spectral Detectors.

The SV 400/1 is a turbo dynamic pump that offers high performance with 100% free of oil and contact during operation. These side channel blowers are low-maintenance, highly efficient, and require only minimal maintenance.
 
Whether you need an individual unit or a system, Becker's vacuum pumps, compressors for blast air, and combined pressure/vacuum pumps are made for the various processes used in the printing and paper industry - from the pre-press stage, to sheet fed and digital presses, to the post-press.
 
Vacuum pumps from Becker are perfectly suited for the absolute precision, low pulsation and vibration, and integrability challenges associated with the manufacturing, processing and testing of all types of electronic components.
 
Becker provides customised vacuum pump and compressor solutions for numerous mechanical engineering applications across the world, such as conveying, transporting, fixing, lifting, handling, drying, cooling and many more.

It is a good show. The last few episodes were the best. The one about the old woman visiting Ground Zero to "visit" her son and needing help getting there made me tear up. No other sitcom has made me do that before.  
  
Wonderful show.
 
I always liked Becker. I watched it when it aired and occasionally still in syndication. I miss shows like it now. There aren't enough comedies on TV now, unless you consider something like Gray's Anatomy a wild farce (when it's really just crap writing).  
  
And...Ted Danson is my age-appropriate crush. (As opposed to my non-age appropriate crushes.)
 
Great timing. I was about to mention Becker here myself - I just saw my old recordings of the german dubbed version again - it started airing 2001.  
  
I saw your name as director on the episode where Linda gets her nosering stuck in her sweater. There are a couple of nice episodes in season 6 though I think the show went downhill after Bob left. Jorge Garcia was never a good replacement for him.  
  
My question would've been if you know anything about how and why Terry Farrel and Saverio Guerra left the show - she dropped out of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine after season 6 and I think it was due to her wanting more money - she was dropped from Becker because of that too I think - is that a fact? Was it the same reason why Guerra left?   
  
To be honest I think the Nancy Travis was a better fit for John Becker anyway. The role of John Becker was a "grownup" role for Ted Danson and I'm really sad that "Help me Help you" didn't catch on either - it was a variation of the same character he played there.  
  
Now he's on Damages and turned into an ass - still better than the doofus he played on Cheers. All in all better than more of Gullivers Travels if you ask me ;-)  
  
This reminds me that I have the first season of Mash sitting here in the shelf - I never watched the show, bought the box because of this blog and I can't force myself to watch it. Somebody tell me again why it's so great. I'll watch it if you guys all watch Becker :-)
 
Hi Ken,  
  
As always, thank you for this blog, love it and read it as a nice little bit of relief towards the end of my day, normally on my phone in some remote part of Australia.  
  
During the writers room scenes in Almost Perfect, when the actors used to come in with weird and wonderful requests, were any of those requests inpsired by real life experiences of the writers?  
I have always been curious about that.  
  
Many thanks Ken.  
cheers

I couldn't understand why someone would think a series with 129 episodes would be considered a failure, but I think the reason it might not have been a bigher hit was because Ted Danson's character was too different from Sam Malone. I think it was probably too close in time to Cheers and Sam was in everyone's memory. People wanted Sam and Becker was not Sam. Nowadays, Cheers is so long ago (sorry, Ken), that the Sam character has faded from memory for some, and may no even be it for others (which makes me feel old).
 
Ken...  
  
Speaking of Ted Danson. He and Jane Kasmerick were involved in, what I consider, a very funny sitcom about two years ago called "Help Me, Help You" on ABC. Jane Lynch (who I love) was even on the show. It failed miserably and I don't understand why. It had so much potential. Why would ABC give up on it so quickly?

Ken,  
  
Does the concept of Development Hell exist in TV too? Are you aware of any shows currently residing there (or in other opaque statuses) that you'd love to see on-screen?  
  
I tried BECKER once (early on) but we didn't get on - too formulaic for my liking.
 
I watched Becker on German syndication, which helped by distancing me to Danson a bit. But I think he didn't convey too many qualities of this character. I think he's pretty stiff for an actor, and doesn't have enough feeling in his body language, which (pre high defintion) tv needs in a comedy ensemble. You have to see him in medium shots with groups and as he is the star this time, most of the lines go to him. But it seemed more interesting to see him with someone, with the group. I wouldn't say the same with Hawkeye, who could hold his own on the screen alone for the time required, and with ensemble.   
It felt like a parts-not-equal-to-the-whole situation. I guess Danson is not really able to hold our attention in the center alone. He needs a Frasier or others around him, and then he is perfect in his less-than-more.
 
Well, I found Dr. Becker a truly abrasive character -- actually to the point of unpleasantness much of the time. I mean, *irredeemably* so. [If I had to choose between being trapped for an hour in a stuck elevator with either Dr. Becker or Archie Bunker, I would happily choose Archie.]   
  
Also -- though I don't mean to sound churlish or humorless in talking about a sitcom -- one episode of BECKER featured a series of gags in which characters intentionally (and almost gleefully) pronounce the disorder Asperger's Syndrome as "Assburger's Syndrome." A cousin of mine has Asperger's; he's constantly mocked and ridiculed. This just wasn't very funny.
 
Agree with Griff to an extent, but it also crosses my mind that a tall, good-looking doctor doesn't have a lot to be constantly irritable about - maybe if it had been (for example) Danny deVito, Or Becker had had a House-type pain issue? I never felt Ted fitted the part - his anger was too controlled, too scary.
 
I really enjoyed watching "Becker" and though it had a terrific ensemble cast - Ted, Terry Farrell, Hattie Winston, Alex Desert, Shawnee Smith, Saverio Guerra. They all meshed so well together. The writing was very smart too.  
  
I could smell the beginning of the end when Nancy Travis joined the show, however.  
  
WV: "Sculari" - former star of "Busum Buddies".
 
Is it just me or did Becker become less of a jerk as the show went on. I liked it when he was cranky and giving his patients a hard time. Also, did he get less political as well? I remember reading something about how there was pressure by the network to make him more likable. Is this true?
 
Ken, I have a couple questions:  
  
1] How easy is it for a star to direct himself, e.g. Kelsey Grammer, in an episode in which his character features prominently?  
  
2] I just watched a "Frasier" two-parter ("Shutout in Seattle") written by your partner, Mr. Isaacs. Were you out of the office that week? How often have you guys gone it alone on writing assignments?
 
I was really enthusiastic about "Becker" when the series began, though I have to say it was largely because I was a huge "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" fan and tuned in "Becker" because I had a huge crush on Terry Farrell. I liked most of the cast in fact with the exception of Saviero Guerra, and that only because I felt the character of Bob was best in occasional small doses. Still for reasons I can't fully explain I lost interest in the show so that by the time Farrell left and Nancy Travis came on as a replacement I wasn't watching. And I hate to say it but replacing Farrell with Travis wasn't exactly going to bring me back - liked her in Almost Perfect but most of the time ther
