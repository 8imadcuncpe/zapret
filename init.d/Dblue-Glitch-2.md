Usually I get lazy and I have multiple tracks for multiple instances of dblue glitch. I fill the bar in with the Nothing value until I want the glitch to play (Like, half of it black, then red)
 
Sugarbytes also makes Turnado - it's a more hands on version of their other glitch style plugin Effectrix. I've been using Effectrix for a few months and like it. I have the Illformed Glitch plug in and find it is very cpu intensive and has a couple of annoying bugs. It occasionally hangs and crashes Logic. It took me a while to understand the workflow in Stutter and it was a bit confusing to set up but I finally got it going a couple of weeks ago and am finding it's really flexible - you can quickly customize your own glitch effect.

In my opinion, this is where the true magic of this glitch VST lies. Not only can you trigger specific effects, but you can alternate between effects. You can even combine effects together into specific sequences!
 
This means this glitch VST is perfect for live performances as well as the studio. It also features controls for each effect. You can dial in precisely the amount as well as custom parameters for each effect:
 
The most common use of this glitch VST is to create cool transitions. However, thanks to its great versatility, you can also use it to process sounds. You could for example create an echo layer to a vocal that is heavily processed and degraded.
 
What makes I Wish unique is the way you interact with it. Basically, you feed it audio, then play notes on your keyboard to pitch-freeze. This means you can instantly transform any sound source into a synth!
 
This is a fancy way of saying you can draw custom automation within the plugin. You can think of it as an advanced LFO module. Assign the envelope to any parameter you want within Stutter Edit 2, then draw a shape. This will instantly create moving effects.
 
Like with most glitch VST plugins, the buffer controls the size and repetition of the slices. Delay controls how fast those slices are played back. Finally, the Filter can be set to Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, and Band-Reject.
 
The document describes the effects applied to an audio corridor using glitch and dub delay effects. The glitch effect made the audio sound very robotic and machine-like by repeatedly clicking the "both" button to find the desired sound. The dub delay effect changed the audio to have an echo-like, far away sound that repeats some words like a harmony. Both effects make the words difficult to understand clearly but the original meaning can still be recognized.Read less
