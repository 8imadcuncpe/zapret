In the first two years of the course, lectures are supplemented with two to three hours of in-college teaching per week, in tutorials and small group classes; third- and fourth-year teaching is via classes. Pure mathematics is taught by Kevin McGerty, an expert in abstract algebra, and Greg Berczi, who works in Geometry. Applied mathematics is taught by Sam Howison and Chris Breward, who work on problems with an interdisciplinary emphasis. The thriving Christ Church mathematics society brings together the whole mathematics community for lectures, student presentations and an annual dinner.
 
Employers like people with maths degrees. Mathematics opens the door to a huge range of careers, for example, further study and research in academia or industry, investment banking, web design, and teaching.

New kinds of data are emerging all the time in science and industry requiring the expert knowledge and experience of statisticians to apply this data. The combination, of deep and mathematically well-grounded method building, and wide-ranging applied work with data, is what makes statistics a great subject.
 
Historically, there have been strong links between Mathematics and Philosophy; logic, an important branch of both subjects, provides a natural bridge between the two, as does the philosophy of mathematics.
 
Both views are correct, probably more so for maths than for any other subject. Indeed it could be said that during your undergraduate years you make the most of the first of these, before earning a living by the second. Equally, the course emphasis on applicable mathematics is also an important aspect of the undergraduate curriculum. Career opportunities for mathematics graduates are excellent. Many graduates choose careers where they exploit their mathematical knowledge, although the majority use their analytical training in ways that are not directly mathematical.

Keble is ideally placed to teach Mathematics, in terms of the expertise of its Fellows and its proximity to the Mathematical Institute where lectures are delivered to all first-year mathematics undergraduates (about 250). Students attend about 10 lectures per week during their first year; Tutorials at Keble are usually given in pairs and triplets, about 2 per week; Classes are given to groups of up to 8 students.
 
We admit students for Mathematics, Mathematics and Statistics, and Mathematics and Computer Science. Added to the Computer Science students, this means we have a large cohort of undergraduates in the mathematical sciences, plus graduates. Together they make up a diverse community of students from all sorts of backgrounds.

We have two Tutorial Fellows in mathematics and statistics. Professor Franois Caron teaches statistics and Professor Andrs Juhsz teaches pure mathematics. Between them, they cover most of the subjects in the undergraduate curriculum, with the exception of some specialised options, which are taught via inter-collegiate classes during the third and fourth years.
 
Mathematics at Corpus is taught by Dr Paul Dellar and Professor Pier Francesco Palamara, assisted by Dr Lucy Auton and Ms Victoria Patel. Within the Joint Schools, Computer Science is taught and overseen by Professor Luke Ong, Philosophy by Professor Marion Durand, and Statistics by Professor Pier Francesco Palamara.



Dr Dellar's research includes lattice Boltzmann approaches for modelling fluids and other physical systems, the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans, and mathematical problems in industry. Professor Palamara's research is at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and genetics.



Teaching is supported by the following lecturers: Mr Matija Tapuskovic, Dr Gonzalo Mena, and Mr Fabian Zaiser.
 
One of the things you will find on starting Maths at University is that there is a change in style and emphasis from what you do at school. You will find that pure mathematics at University introduces new and more abstract and fundamental ideas in courses on algebra and analysis; and in particular you will realise the central importance of proof. A subject like differential equations is treated as applied, for example because the problems of mechanics may be framed in their terms. (Indeed, the study of many parts of mathematics was first couched in terms of applications to physical problems.)
 
The first year course gives you a broad grounding in the basics of the subject, in both pure and applied mathematics, on which to build your mathematical understanding. At the end of Trinity (summer) Term you will take Prelims, a series of five exams.
 
The first term of the second year continues with more core courses, and after that you will start to specialize in your chosen aspects of mathematics. At this point students have usually developed some preferences, and their mathematical style is beginning to emerge; so you head towards becoming an analyst, or an algebraist, or a probabilist.
 
Throughout your first two years you will have about two tutorials a week in college, typically as a pair and occasionally as a class of up to six. From the start of your third year you specialize further, and support for lectures is through classes of about 8 or 10 organised at a departmental level. All colleges have such a pattern of teaching.
 
Typical applicants have a mixture of A levels, often double Maths with at least one Arts subject, and they are committed to mathematics but also have a strong desire to retain a balance and explore the world of philosophy. You need to be good at both subjects to read Maths and Philosophy, and in particular to be comfortable writing essays that explore philosophical concepts.
 
The same applies to applicants in Maths and Computer Science as in Maths and Philosophy. You need to be good at both subjects to do this, though the computer science is mostly treated in a mathematical manner. Recent Corpus students have performed very well in this joint degree.
 
This is a popular course, which naturally prepares you in particular for statistical applications. The first year is identical to that for Mathematics. Because Statistics is more closely aligned with Mathematics, this course is more closely "joint" than the two joint degrees mentioned above.
 
The main distinction between the two courses is that the four year course enables you to go further. The fourth year is akin to a first graduate year (or an MSc). Typically half or more of our students carry on to the fourth year. (If you are unsure about which is for you, it is best to apply initially for the four-year course.)
 
The University's Mathematical Institute will run live broadcasts every Thursday from 5 pm until 7 pm (August 2022, until the test date in early November) which involves working through MAT problems and chatting about maths. For edited-down 'maths-only' videos from the 2020 livestream, please see the YouTube playlist.
 
"The course at Oxford is such that in your first year you study a large range of topics, this is the perfect chance to really explore the world of maths and see where your interests lie. Then, from your second year, you can start to specialise and go down whichever path you enjoy the most."
 
Some students go on to do doctoral research. Many others leave for jobs, often in finance or actuarial work, or in teaching. A good degree in mathematics or one of the joint courses is great preparation for many other graduate careers that do not necessarily require specialist mathematical knowledge.
 
Oxford Maths 2e includes a wealth of hands-on activities, small-group and whole-class tasks, practice exercises and open-ended problem-solving opportunities. It helps students make connections with mathematics in the real world and encourages higher-order thinking and reasoning.
 
Markbook Teacher Dashboard provides an easy-to-access snapshot of class and student progress, enabling teachers to view test performance, highlight areas of success and identify opportunities for additional support.
 

 Our Student Books are based on a developmental approach that
incorporates initial scaffolding, which is gradually reduced to allow
students to become confident and independent mathematicians, with clear and simple layouts to maximise student learning and understanding.
Topics follow a scope and sequence that supports the sequential
acquisition of mathematical skills, concepts and knowledge.
 
Available via Oxford Owl, the Teacher Dashboards provide online access to a wealth of teaching resources and support materials. Effectively support your students at their point of need by accessing lesson plans, learning support.


- A wealth of teaching resources and support materials including term planners, curriculum links and Markbook.
- Learning sequences to meet the diverse needs of students with different ability levels.
