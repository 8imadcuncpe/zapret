The core philosophy of MODX is Creative Freedom. You should be able to do what you want, use whatever framework or technology you want and have full control over the output of the CMS. There are plugins, or extras as we call them, to help with generic tasks such as creating menus or extracting resources from the database. But these extras are much less invasive than many plugins in WP, and they all leave you in charge of the templating with, indeed, these chunks of your own HTML.
 
As for importing data into MODX: there is a CSV import option for resources, and also an extra called ImportX, but I have no experience in using them. I did a few imports from WordPress though, with these scripts as base:
 
Thanks for your comments!!! I know that webflow has a CMS feature where I can import my radio shows (they are hosted on the castos servers). Castos is a podcasting company so I would have to import the iframe code for each episode, including the episode name, year and playlist into tilda or webflow and take it from there.

I was in the same situation as you about leaving WP. I then choose Modx and then found that Modx can do Magic. The catch is that you have to practice before become a master.
Take a look around, use Collections, Tagger, PDOtools, TinyMce, Ace, SEO Suit, FormIt, ClientConfig, a nice bootstrap theme and you are good to go.
Modx is the CMS you can trust. We all are here to help you.
If you are stuck with WP then I suggest you to try Pods Plugin there.
**But my recommendation is Modx with those Extras I mentioned.**
 
VersionX is a utility tool for MODX Revolution that will help you version your content in Resources, Templates, Chunks, Snippets and Plugins. Every change is recorded and can easily be looked back, compared and restored through the component, or the optional "Versions" tabs that get added to the update screens.

Simply install the package through package manager and if desired tick the boxes to create snapshots of current content. There are some instructions in the documentation as well, but most of the package works automatically.
 
I was looking for a method to put a Live Set together more efficiently so I took the advice of others and bought JUST the Live Set portion. I then found out I also needed Total Librarian (would have been nice to have a disclaimer that one won't work without the other). I didn't want to pay the extra money for the Performance Editor because I don't need it.
 
I was under the impression that I could simply drag and drop the sounds from the library to where I wanted in the Live Set. Not s'much. When I do, an entirely different sound appears in the Live Set. Same USER file and number, just an entirely different preset.
 
When you create a USER Performance either by storing it as a new performance or by overwriting an existing User Performance, it is stored in one of 640 User Bank locations. There are some 2227 Factory Performances, and some 5120 possible Library Performances.
 
BadMister, how would Carol transfer ONE performance to her MODX, from Melas software, AND set it to her chosen Live Sets slot, without transferring everything from the Melas Library's definition of USER4 to the MODX's User4?
 
In the LIVE SET EDITOR I right clicked. It did not give me the option to "Send to Edit Buffer". When in TOTAL LIBRARY I right clicked, it gave me the option to "Send to Edit Buffer" HOWEVER, I have to save the performance and if I'm not very very very careful, it will create a duplicate.
 
But if I can get all the programs that I want into the LIVE SET, then it will be one step closer to doing what I want it to do. And we've now "circled back" to my original problem. See first part of thread. (insert forehead slap here)
 
I would highly recommend the entire suite of Editors if you are truly looking for efficiency. And I highly recommend thoroughly understanding the front panel manipulation of Live Set data and Performance HOME locations right along with learning the Editors.
 
Hopefully (and I know more than enough about computers to know that hope and faith is part of using them), you'll be able to right click on Boyz in the Total Librarian list and choose the VERY poorly named "Send to Edit Buffer" option (which is actually "load and make active on MODX") where you can then immediately play it with the keyboard, and save it with any name you like, anywhere you like on your MODX.
 
Also, it's about time Yamaha realised it's not good at hiring and controlling their outsourced devs, and instead sent a bucket of money to John Melas, and let him incorporate his tools as free downloads for all MODX and Montage users.
 
Badmister: I AM AWARE ON HOW LIVE SETS WORKS. You're just not understanding the problem...there appear to be some disconnect in our conversation. As Andrew explained, the only way to Send to Edit Buffer is through the Total Librarian. As I explained before, YES, I can save the project there, but simply SAVING will not allow me to overwrite an existing USER patch. I have to save it as new...thereby creating a duplicate. If I take the very same preset "BOYZ" send it to the "edit buffer", I HAVE to save it, but it will only save it as a NEW USER PATCH...ERGO...DUPLICATE.
 
The name chosen by J. Melas is based on standard terminology that is documented in the manuals. The name is correct because it identifies what Yamaha calls this memory store. Maybe the name could be revised on Yamaha's side - but Melas has named this the best thing -- the agreed upon name that Yamaha docs use.
 
**Edit buffer**
The edit buffer is the memory location for edited data of these types: Performance, Live Set, and Song.
Although the edit buffer is designed specifically for data writing and data reading, the data contained in
the edit buffer is lost when the power is turned off. You should always store edited data to User memory
before editing new performance or before turning off the power. Data other than Performance and Motion
Sequence are automatically stored.
 
Sample Robot by SKYLIFE is a spiffy tool for copping sounds from old keyboards or any other sound source. Yamaha formed a parnership with SKYLIFE resulting in Sample Robot for Montage, a version of Sample Robot that is tailor-made for Montage (and MODX).
 
Upon start-up, SRM displays a wizard leading you through the task of setting essential project characteristics like sample rate and such. In a moment of hubris, I cancelled the wizard the first time through and found the app to be somewhat inert. Me-thinks SRM needs to initialize its environment and clicking through the start-up wizard at least once does the trick.
 
Apple licensed pretty decent samples. I once tried to determine their original source and vaguely remember Sonic Reality. Others thought VSL lite (circa 2003). Association with Garageband unfairly cheapened their reputation.
 
I did a little bit of prep work. I renamed the AIF files, putting the center note into standard form. I checked the samples in Yamaha Tiny Wave Editor (TWE) to see if they were looped. (They were.) I normalized the samples using TWE. Turns out, SRM can normalize and I could have accomplished this task in SRM instead.
 
Admittedly, what came next were my most frustrating moments. I either imported one individual sample file or just the last sample file in the selected list. Arg! Long story short, it came down to finding the right combination of import settings.
 
The first screenshot shows the state of the project after a successful import. The samples are laid out correctly across the keyboard as derived from the sample file names. Further, SRM did a smashing job with the keybank ranges.
 
Sometimes a new waveform requires polish. The sample levels may be uneven across the keyboard or a sample may be out of tune. The MODX UI is well up to the job allowing tweaks for level and fine pitch.
 
We use the best tools available within our agency. This applies to our hardware, software, but also for our web applications. Therefore we use MODX as our content management system: flexibility and speed of implementation are two of the many strengths of MODX. We created several extras for MODX to enhance the user experience and the ability to optimize it for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
 
FormIt is a dynamic form processing snippet for MODX Revolution developers. It handles form submission, validation, and follow-up actions like sending an email or storing encrypted versions of these emails for later reference.
