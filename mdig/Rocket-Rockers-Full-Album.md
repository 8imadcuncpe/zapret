The 71-year-old has said his current outing will be his final journey down the yellow brick road of touring, but the tour is scheduled to stretch until 2021, so don't rule out one more trip through the Motor City before it's all said and done.

**Christina Aguilera, Oct. 13, Fox Theatre**: It's been 11 years and a few dozen pop cycles since Aguilera last performed in the area, with an April 2007 visit to the Palace of Auburn Hills. (For perspective: At the time, Miley Cyrus was still best known as Hannah Montana.) Xtina is now back, touring on the heels of this year's "Liberation" album, performing a hits-heavy show that touches on all eras of her nearly 20-year career.
 
**The Eagles, Oct. 14, Little Caesars Arena**: Hell froze over long ago. Once was a time when you couldn't get the Eagles to hit the road, now you can't keep them off of it. The classic rockers return to LCA one year after playing the venue on a short tour in the wake of Glenn Frey's 2016 death, with Frey's son Deacon carrying on his father's legacy on guitar and vocal duty.
 
**Foo Fighters, Oct. 15, Little Caesars Arena**: Foo Fighters were never supposed to be one of the biggest bands of their generation, things just kind of worked out that way. Now the group is among a small class of '90s alt-rockers still performing at the arena level, and their current tour comes in support of 2017's "Concrete and Gold," the band's ninth studio effort.

**In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert the Hologram Tour, Oct. 20, Fox Theatre**: When 2Pac appeared in hologram form at the 2012 Coachella festival, industry observers figured they were witnessing the future of posthumous performances on concert stages. That largely hasn't happened, but the Orbison tour -- which kicked off in the UK earlier this year -- is a huge leap forward for the idea that death is merely a hurdle in the pursuit of entertaining audiences. The Orbison hologram, the creation of Las Vegas-based BASE Hologram, will be backed by a live orchestra.
 
**Nine Inch Nails, Oct. 22 and 23, Fox Theatre**: Trent Reznor and company went old-school for this tour, initially forgoing online sales and selling tickets in person to fans who lined up at the box office. Shows have seen the veteran band digging through its dense catalog, playing 1992's "Broken" in full at one show and unearthing 1997's "The Perfect Drug" for the first time ever in concert at another stop. What fans will get at these two shows is anyone's guess.
 
**Twenty One Pilots, Oct. 24, Little Caesars Arena**: Backing "Trench," the Columbus duo's first album since its 2015 breakthrough "Blurryface," the "Stressed Out" hitmaker headline its first Detroit arena concert. The group has built its following slowly and steadily, picking up fans as it's moved up the ranks from clubs to theaters and beyond. This Little Caesars Arena concert is the group's first local show since a 2016 concert at DTE Energy Music Theatre.
 
**Luke Bryan, Oct. 26, Ford Field**: The country megastar returns for yet another go-round at Ford Field, which he's made his traditional tour closer over the last few years. The 42-year-old is touring on the heels of last year's "What Makes You Country," which birthed the singles "Light It Up" and "Most People are Good," and he's not coming alone, bringing Sam Hunt, DJ Rock, Morgan Wallen, Carly Pearce and Jon Pardi with him for the ride.
 
**MC50, Oct. 26, St. Andrews Hall; Oct. 27, Fillmore Detroit**: Still kicking out the jams, 50 years later. Wayne Kramer leads this reconstituted version of the MC5, the Detroit proto-punk pioneers, which includes Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil, King's X singer/bassist Dug Pinnick, Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty and Zen Guerrilla frontman Marcus Durant. These two back-to-back Detroit shows wrap up the band's 35-date North American tour, which will be followed by a series of UK dates.
 
**Travis Scott, Dec. 5, Little Caesars Arena**: On his last tour, the Houston rapper employed the use of a giant mechanical bird. Since this tour sees him supporting his amusement park-themed No. 1 album "Astroworld," don't be surprised if the wildly energetic performer is backed on stage by a full roller coaster set-up. With Trippie Redd, Sheck Wes and Gunna.
 
The non-fiction bestsellers' lists were decorated with rock memoirs all year as I Am Ozzy, Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir and Keith Richards' Life educated readers about what being a real rock star is like. And in looking back at concerts in 2010, the most successful tours were all rock bands: Bon Jovi, U2 and AC/DC. Rock also infiltrated Broadway with the continued success of the '80s-themed "Rock Of Ages" and Green Day's "American Idiot." The U2-scored "Spider-Man" production also hit the stage. There were also landmark tours in terms of production in rock concerts this year as Roger Waters built and destroyed The Wall for the first time in 30 years, and Rammstein lit Madison Square Garden on fire in their first U.S. show in 10 years.
 
However, as 2010 brought anniversaries, landmarks and reunions, many significant figures in rock, punk, industrial, and metal music left us. To Ronnie James Dio, Malcolm McLaren, Jay Reatard, Paul Gray, Alex Chilton, Peter Steele, Derf Scratch, Peter Christopherson, and Captain Beefheart: Your work will continue to live in our hearts, minds and ears, inspiring a new generation of rockers to come.

The band's self-titled debut album was unleashed upon the world in 1984, and lead single "Runaway" made some waves. Yet the New Jersey group didn't truly break through until their third album, the 12 million-selling Slippery When Wet. By the late 1980s, they were arguably the biggest rock band in the world, selling out massive shows in arenas and stadiums.
 
By the time he was in high school, Jon Bongiovi (his original, pre-fame last name) was already fronting his first serious group. The Atlantic City Expressway was a 10-piece with a horn section that performed well-known tunes from Jersey acts like Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.
 
Bon Jovi got a gig as a gopher at Power Station, the famed studio co-owned by his second cousin Tony Bongiovi where artists like the Rolling Stones, Diana Ross, and David Bowie recorded. (He watched even watched Bowie and Freddie Mercury record the vocals for "Under Pressure.")
 
Jon stuck with the team until 2009, a year after they won Arena Bowl XXII, defeating the San Jose SaberCats. He then set his eyes on a bigger prize, the Buffalo Bills, aligning himself with a group of Toronto investors in 2011. One of his biggest competitors? Donald Trump, who ran a smear campaign alleging that the famed singer would move the team to Toronto.
 
In 1987, they co-wrote and produced the Top 20 hit "We All Sleep Alone" with Child for Cher, and also co-wrote the Top 40 hit "Notorious" with members of Loverboy. In 1989, the duo paired up again Loverboy guitarist Paul Dean for his solo rocker "Under The Gun" and bequeathed the New Jersey outtake "Does Anybody Really Fall in Love Anymore?" (co-written with Child and Diane Warren) to Cher.
 
The Bon Jovi/Sambora song "Peace In Our Time" was recorded by Russian rockers Gorky Park. In 1990, Paul Young snagged the New Jersey leftover "Now and Forever," while the duo penned "If You Were in My Shoes" with Young, though neither song was released. In 2009, Bon Jovi and Sambora were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame for their contributions to music.
 
The group did 15-month tours to support both the Slippery When Wet and New Jersey albums. Near the end of the grueling Slippery tour, Bon Jovi was getting steroid injections because his voice was suffering.
 
Reflecting this evolved viewpoint, the band started an annual tradition of playing a December concert in New Jersey to raise money for various charitable causes; the concert series began in 1991 and continued with the band or Jon solo through at least 2015. The group have played various charitable concert events over the years including the Twin Towers Relief Benefit, Live 8 in Philadelphia, and The Concert For Sandy Relief.
 
By the late 2000s, Jon and Dorothea founded the JBJ Soul Kitchen to serve meals at lower costs to people who cannot afford them. COVID-19 related food shortages led the couple to found the JBJ Soul Kitchen Food Bank. Their JBJ Soul Foundation supports affordable housing and has rebuilt and refurbished homes through organizations like Project H.O.M.E., Habitat For Humanity, and Rebuilding Together.
 
Since 2001, Primavera Sound has served as Barcelona's kickoff to summer. And with a stacked lineup chock full of effervescent acts for its 2024 iteration, this year's fest will certainly get the feel-good, warm-weather vibes rolling.
 
Phoenix starts the party with pop rock and new wave on May 29, setting the stage for fellow headliners Pulp, Vampire Weekend, and Justice on May 30. Lana Del Rey, The National, and Disclosure will make everyone's Friday night on May 31. Then, SZA, PJ Harvey, Mitski, and Charli XCX will ring in June on Saturday, before house/electronic acts ANOTR, The Blessed Madonna, Chlo Caillet, and Mochakk close things out on June 2.
 
But the headliners are just the beginning of what makes this year's Primavera Sound Barcelona exciting. Peggy Gou, L'Imperatrice, or Omar Apollo will likely tease new tunes, as they all gear up for June album releases. And just a month ag
