This person also manages which services you can use. Because the administrator is part of your organization, not part of Google, we can't tell you exactly who that person is. But here are ideas of who to ask.
 
There are several ways that Windows Autopatch service communicates with customers. To streamline communication and ensure we're checking with the right people when you submit a support request, you must provide a set of admin contacts when you onboard with Windows Autopatch.

You might have already added these contacts in the Microsoft Intune admin center during the enrollment process, or if you've submitted a tenant enrollment support request. However, take a moment to double-check that the contact list is accurate, since the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team must be able to reach them if a severe incident occurs.

You must have an admin contact for each specified area of focus. The Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team will contact these individuals for assistance with your support request. Admin contacts should be the best person or group that can answer questions and make decisions for different areas of focus.
 
Whoever you choose as admin contacts, they must have the knowledge and authority to make decisions for your Windows Autopatch environment. The Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team will contact these admin contacts for questions involving support requests.
 
Please how can I find the administrator of the whole account? I'm actually admin on my client's project, so I thought I was supposed to have all the abilities to config my boards. nevertheless, I only can edit the existing workflow without add another one
 
Welcome to community! I would recommend either opening a ticket with IT at your company or if you scroll down to the bottom of your Jira site, if it was configured there should be a "Report a Problem" button in Jira. If you click that button you can submit a request there and that should go to the admins of your instance.
 
Depending how the team at your company set it up then yes that's accurate. The team who manages your Jira instance controls their own intake and would have configured it to do that. It's built to only be an email, so if it goes to a Jira board then it means they used an email that routes to a jira board, which is not a pre-built function but something custimized.
 
Hi everyone, we are slated to cutover to Microsoft Teams Phone later this week. Everything is working well except this one last bit: the driver phonebook. We are a trucking company and have over 200 drivers listed as Contacts in our Microsoft 365 Admin center, under Users. This makes sense because we want to be able to type in thier name and call them, and to see their name pop up when they are calling in.
 
But I am struggling to find if it is now possible, in June 2023, to automatically fill every user's Teams Phone Contacts with the entirety of this organizational Contacts list. I'm talking about the contacts shown here orgwide:
 
Everything I'm finding on the internet is from 2021 or earlier. There are mentions to UserVoice thredas but when you click the link, these UserVoices are no longer online. My vain hope is that this is because they've implemented a fix and I just need to know what it is.
 
We really don't want to have to manually import these drivers because, as is the case with all trucking companies, driver turnover is astronomical and we get and lose new drivers ever week. On our old phone system, we had a CSV we exported from our ERP containing all the drivers' names, emails, and phone numbers. We then just had to import it weekly.
 
We can do this same import mechanism on Microsoft 365 Admin contacts, but what I can't figure out is how to get those contacts to appear for our users in Teams Phone without them having to manually add these contacts to their own personal contacts list.
 
@eliekarkafy Thank you for this suggestion! I followed the steps and it "worked": I have a Shared Contacts tab inside the all-company team's General channel. But it doesn't seem to have any kind of native connection with Teams Phone. I would like these contacts to show up as Contacts in Teams so that they can simply type the person's name and call them, and make their own custom contact groups with the drivers they care about.
 
All signs I can find indicate that even though Global Address Book is part of the same Microsoft Tenant, it refuses to load anything except the contacts in each individual user's main Contacts folder from Outlook.
 
i have narrowed it down to creating a new admin role group and giving them access to a specific role. However i have read over every role and tried several and nothing seems to give them the correct access. and any guide i have read has different (probably outdated) roles.
 
Right, that is a Tenant setting that needs to be enabled in order to create embed codes or Publish to web codes. However, I will say that sometimes I get that message even when I know the tenant setting is enabled. I just have try again and it works. Generally happens immediately after I publish my report and then go to it via the "Open this report" link that you get after you publish.
 
I have enabled the settnigs but i am still getting same response that admin need to enable the settings. I don't understand. Although i am using a developer account with pro license. May that be the reason?
 
I have the exact same issue, Juan! I understand that I need to select "Allow existing and new codes" but that doesn't appear for me. I also see the same message that says "To enable Publish to Web you must disable Block Public Internet Access first" but when I find that (under "Advanced Networking", it's also already disabled!?
 
If you just check the box that IS there (I think it says "Only allow existing codes" or something) then when you save/refresh, it updates to say "Allow existing and new codes"... It doesn't really make sense at all, but it did work for me!
 
Hi all. I have been using a google account that I got from a shared workspace. Its from a vendor who resells cloud space. I have my own email and password to log into the account. recently I got a message for google that my account has been recently deleted. The admin is unreachable now, I can't expect any help from him. I have valuable data on that google drive. How can I recover them?
 
There are a number of options there including getting in touch with support as well as technical methods to prove to Google that you own your domain name and should be allowed to access the Workspace instance.
 
Each organization requires at least an Admin & Tech contact. These roles will be responsible for receiving automatic notifications regarding system alerts. **The Contact Roles must be an Organization Admin or Channel Admin.**
 
**If you are attempting to delete a user that is currently assigned to one of these three roles, it will create an error stating that you cannot delete the user at this time. To correct, please assign the role to a different email and attempt to delete the user now that it does not hold the designated role.**
 
This will allow you to edit all information regarding your account. Towards the bottom will be drop-down lists that you can select to change who will receive notifications and communications regarding the roles. When each of the roles have been selected as desired, click **Save.**

Being an "admin" in osTicket does not mean that you have unlimited unfettered access to tickets. It means that you have access to changing osTicket Settings. If you want to have access to tickets you will have to grant your account access to the Departments or Teams that the tickets are assigned to.

It's possible to allow end users to directly contact an administrator from the block page. After filling out the contact form, the email sent to the administrator contains the user's message as well as diagnostic information.
 
The file-provider is used to initially generate the users.xml and authorizations.xml files. Once these files exist they will not be re-generated or modified if you later make changes to this configuration xml. Basically if the users.xml and authorizations.xml files already exist, the file-provider will do nothing.
 
I have the same issue, I was able to login through certificate "CN=Adminstrator, OU=NIFI", but when I switched to ldap I got an error "Unknown user with identity 'CN=Adminstrator, OU=NIFI'. Contact the system administrator."
 
Since your existing setup already works with your original user certificate, I would suggest authenticating to your NiFi with that certificate and then adding your new user "admin" via the users UI from within the NiFi interface.
 
You can always delete/rename the existing "users.xml" and "authorizations.xml" files so that new copies are generated on startup, but keep in mind that you will lose and authorizations you may have manually added through the NiFi interface.
