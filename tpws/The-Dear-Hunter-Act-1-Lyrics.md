This is the Dear Hunter juggling whether or not he can stay with Ms. Leading. He realizes that no matter how much he loves her, he will always have his doubts. He will always suspect that she is cheating on him. He's making himself too vulnerable to heartbreak by loving her so much. He realizes that if they just part ways, he can never catch her cheating on him so he decides the best thing to do is separate.

"Cause you cant be caught red handed if your not red handedMy darling I would never say those words to you"the dear hunter is saying that if she actually isn't doing anything, she can't be caught for it. The only way to completely prevent that is to not see her. He loves her so much that he couldn't stand the thought.
 
"Was it bitter when you tossed and turnedOn an under covered mattress did it feel so good hope it felt so goodDont know what Id do if you lost sleep over little old meIts so much better, their all much betterTake off your sweater your shoes and your shirt and get to work"
 
He's confronting her on her lifestyle. Asking her if she enjoys it, and if she ever thinks about him while she's doing it. And yes, I think he is just being arrogant when he tells her to "get to work"
 
it's really simple, most guys always have the thought lingering in their heads if their girlfriend is cheating on them or not. so even if the girl never did anything wrong, he'd still wonder if she's loyal. and his heart is on the line.

Also I think when he says "Oh my god what have I done" he's kind of questioning himself being like "What was I thinking being suspicious of you" and then it's pretty simple when he's like "I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve"...
 
Since then, the question has been eating at him and finally he explodes. He guesses (perhaps because of his mother) that Ms. Leading is a prostitute and has been playing him, so he yells at her and treats her like a prostitute.
 
Then he stops himself and tells her to put her clothes back on. He feels ashamed for having treated her like that. This time, he takes a calmer approach and tells her that he doesn't know whether or not she is a prostitute and that he would probably have been paranoid no matter what.
 
He also realizes because of this display of emotion that he is much more in love with her than he thought, and thus more vulnerable to getting hurt. This thought is what leads him down the path of breaking up with her.
 
the line "oh my god what have i dont/ my darling put your clothes back on" switches between two time periods. one when the boy is having sexy time with Ms leading, (the hooker), and another when he walks in on her with another man. Casey posted that on some forums a long time ago regarding the FIRST version of red hands from the demo's.
 
I was fairly certain after listening to this that he is referring to Ms. Leading and his heartbreak at discovering her to be a prostitute. Then, because of his heartbreak and the fact that he feels foolish for ever trusting her, he tries to pretend that he never did love her - "I love you" being the three words I think he refers to when saying "My darling I would never say those words to you".He thinks about the time he spent with her and how her hands were "marooned so freshly red" and refuses to believe that she ever really loved him if she could be unfaithful, when the reality was probably that she had no choice.Unable to see this, He gets incredibly bitter and upset and throws a bunch of insults her way; "Take off your sweater your shoes and your shirt and get to work" being a particularly below the belt comment, I thought.
