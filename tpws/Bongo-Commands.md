What I mean is really that if you do a 2D or 3D rotation in Rhino, you essentially enter the info needed by Bongo to automagically create a rotation in Bongo, although more and/or refined properties could be set in Bongo after the rotate-connection is established. A boost in user friendliness.

I agree, but without getting too technical, certain transformations (rotations) are especially complicated. There are also transformations that can be done with commands that Bongo does not support (shearing). But this already happens to some degree currently with the gumball translations.
 
I have tried to boot both ubuntu and arch on my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2010). Both seem to boot, for example ubuntu makes its little bongo noise, and I can type zsh commands when arch boots. But the problem is that nothing is displayed on the screen.

When I boot arch or ubuntu, apart from a bit of text at the beginning of the boot, right before the screen goes blank. The welcome to arch linux with the green [ ok ]s doesn't show up. However, if I wait a while, about the time it takes to boot into the zsh shell, and type reboot, or shutdown -h now, nothing shows up on the screen, but the commands work, and my mac reboots or shuts down.
 
I have a pc laptop with arch installed (it doesn't have UEFI though), and it seems like my mac screen goes blank when my pc screen would go blank and then the text would reappear a little smaller and better fit to the screen. My mac is El Capitan (10.11) if that makes any difference. I've tried booting with and without a partition ready for linux.
 
I was able to solve the problem by pressing alt, when the mac boots (like usual), but instead of running arch, I pressed e, and added nomodeset at the beginning of the line that showed up. Then pressed enter to boot. After installing arch linux, I had to add that kernel parameter to refind, my boot manager, to use nomodeset whenever I booted to the Arch Linux I installed on my hard drive.
 
PowerShell is a task automation and configuration framework developed by Microsoft, made from a command-line windows and a scripting language. Windows 10 closely aligns it's functionality to this language.
 
The simple answer is almost anything you can think of. For example you could create a report of all the USB devices installed on your PC, perform your favourite CMD tasks, kill a process in PowerShell rather than in Task Manager, change permissions on folders/drives.
 
$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri -liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection [connects to the Exchange admin centre, specific module] Import-PSSession $Session -DisableNameChecking [imports the commands from EXO to PowerShell]
 
I'm in the middle of trying to set a static source IP for a Server 2012R2 webserver using This Powershell script but when I run the Get-NetIPAddres command I get 'the term Get-NetIPAddres' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet'. If I run **Get-Command get-netip\*** it only returns the following commands:
 
***Donkey Kong Jungle Beat*** finally swung into stores not so long ago, peeling open hours of fun never thought possible with a pair of plastic bongos. Everyone's favourite red-tied gorilla has returned to the much-demanded, side-scrolling platform genre - and with him he brings a new way of control, with the DK Bongos. Never would we have guessed that bongos could make a platform game *so much* fun.
 
After we exposed Jungle Beat for the first time last year, at first look it seemed rather a simplified affair; using the pair of bongo drums, you move Kong around the gorgeous side-scrolling environments by taping the left drum to move him left, the right drum to move right. Hit both drums together to make him jump, and clap to create shockwaves that stun enemies, pop bubbles and so on.
 
This may seem tricky at first, after years of using a d-pad or analogue stick - but a well-defined learning curve assures that Jungle Beat never throws you into hot water too early. The array of demo movies shown between levels also clue you in on certain techniques and make sure you rack up alot more bananas on a second play-through.
 
The aim of the game is to run, jump and swing through each level collecting as many bananas as possible - either by picking them up from the ground, or by defeating enemies. Performing 'combos' (that is, for example, wall-jumping or vine-swinging without touching the ground) will multiply the number of bananas you bag. Once you touch the ground, your combo is over. As things progress, you'll learn lots of new techniques, like leaping between opposing walls, flying around on birds and so on - and all with simple bongo commands. It's just inspiring gameplay design.
 
Each 'Kingdom' contains two stages each about 5 minutes long. At the end of these stages you're faced with a mini-game where you have to drum as fast as you can to rack up bonus bananas, after which you will face off with one of the four main boss types. Your banana stash acts as your 'health', and you'll lose them, *Sonic*-style, when taking damage.
 
After defeating a boss enemy the bananas you've collected give you a ranking. Bronze is rewarded simply for completing the stage, Silver for collecting 400 bananas, Gold for 800 bananas and Platinum for a seemingly impossible 1200 bananas. These rankings are then used to unlock new stages in the game.
 
And just when you think you've beaten the final boss to the ground, a whole new set of levels are unlocked - requiring you to go back and replay a lot of earlier levels, in order to keep unlocking new ones. And that's when we really started to appreciate the thought that's gone into the level design; you need to use every trick in the book to squeeze out every last banana. Jumping off walls and swinging from monkey-nests to keep combos alive, which really is the key to collecting those crucial last few bananas which will get you the ranking you need. This *NiGHTS*-style scoring system always works superbly in titles like this.
 
The stages are extremely varied, presenting a very compelling and interesting gameplay experience. Through the course of the game, you'll swim in the ocean through sunken ships, ride a buffalo from a giant pursuing lizard though a snowy valley, practice your juggling combos in a dusty desert.
 
Somewhat conversely the bosses are limited in variety, but still interesting and fun to battle against. The four main boss types are Kong (a fist-fight where you dodge with a clap and punch with a drum-roll), Hog (A warthog who throws fruit at you), Roc (a bird holding an egg which you need to break) and tusk (a robotic elephant who shoots at you with his trunk-cannon. Obviously).
 
Each time you come up against these bosses they're a little bit harder and bring you a challenge to face in order to keep hold of your precious bananas. Soon we found ourselves hopelessly addicted to collecting every last banana, hopefully coming out of the boss fights unscathed in order to get those gold and (gulp) platinum rankings. Simply put, this is crack with bongos.
 
The only disappointing thing is that, like most comparable games these days, it's all over too quick. You'll probably extend the experience by having to stop, due to bongo-induced exhaustion - but the game could easily be finished in a day. While the style of the game is very much arcade, it still appeals to the sort of enthusiast player who's gonna go back to these stages, and collect every last banana and explore every last crevice.
 
If you're either kind of gamer, by all means this is the game for you. But if 90 hours of story-driven gameplay is more your bag, you'll probably get a limited - albeit extremely enjoyable - experience from Jungle Beat. Whataver the case, this is absolutely worthy of your attention.GraphicsSoundGameplayDepthPresentation**OVERALL**7.06.58.07.07.07.5
THE VERDICT: Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is a refreshing game experience, proving that the Bongos are definitely not just a gimmick. It's far too much fun for these beauties not to be considered an essential peripheral for any GameCube owner's collection. All that brings the score down is the longevity, but DKJB's replay value is still considerable with all the obsessive banana-collecting scoring system and unlockable levels. 

Buy this game. It even has ninja monkeys.

Chicago-born Jack Costanzo fell in love with Afro-Cuban rhythm instruments when he was 14. By the time of his passing last Saturday at age 98, he'd lived a life full of music, become a friend and teacher to Hollywood stars, and introduced a generation of Americans to bongos and conga drums.
 
Like vibraphonist Cal Tjader, Costanzo started out as a dancer. Jack was so moved by the Cuban sounds that were filtering into the US, he visited Havana several times to learn how to play conga drums and bongos.
 
**Historical note:** In the photo above, Costanzo is tuning the bongos by gently heating the drumheads from underneath, with a hot plate. That was the traditional way of stretching the calfskin or goat skin drumheads until they resonated to a certain tone. Synthetic drumhead materials and sophisticated tuning mechanisms were introduced around 1957.
 
The native operations of NAND flash memory are quite different from those required of a traditional block device. The flash translation layer (FTL), as the name suggests, translates the block-device commands into operations on flash memory. This translation is by no means trivial; both the granularity and the fundamental operations differ. SSD co
