In my head, I kept comparing myself to the wizard of words, Jhumpa Lahiri, and how she had legitimized her love affair with Italian, writing an entire book in it, giving interviews, going out in the world with so much gravitas about her love for the new tongue. I, on the other hand, had barely started picking up the language after I moved in with my partner in mid-2018.

As much as we were a part of the same religion, we did not celebrate it at such lengths. Whenever around them, I would try to listen in on their conversations. I wanted to know the real reason behind the celebrations, and somehow it seemed to me that their language was a portal to that. At my house, we only ever celebrated weddings this way, for days on end, stretching to a couple of weeks, at times.
 
I would hear M speak with parents, argue with friends, politely chat with a colleague, or bargain with a vendor. Subconsciously the language started making home in the crevices of my being. Without even the slightest of prodding I would be able to recall words before colleagues, displaying an unending eagerness to learn more and more.
 
It was jittery, an exercise in extreme patience and anxiety, but I felt charged. I moved through it electrically, responding to this urge that emanated out of nowhere. I had to fight the natural instinct to give in, back off, be my lazy self, but I continued learning.
 
In my extended friend circle, I was probably the only one who did not know more than three languages. The Indian equivalent to the dumb, vulgar, uncouth, uncultured American. I hated it and wanted to get rid of the tag. I wanted to show off too, like a guy from the Hindi film industry I was once friends with who knew a sum total of seven Indian languages, and then English. Ashen-faced, I had not been able to look him in the eye then. In this way, learning Bangla for me was an attempt to belong to a bigger populace, to outdo myself and to keep my language-oriented brain engaged.

Percent of young women between 15 and 19 who are married: 51 percent, compared to 3.9 percent in the United States. Legal Age for marriage: 21 for men and 18 for women without parental consent. With parental consent there are no age limits. [Source: UNICEF, United Nations Data data.un.org]
 
Teenage marriage is a big problem in Bangladesh. Ranking in the top 10 among countries with the worst child marriage rates, the country is home to 38 million child brides, including currently married girls and women who were first married in child hood. Of these 15 million married before they were 15. Fifty-one percent of women in Bangladesh were married before their 18th birthday.

Marriages between cousins are common. It has traditionally not been unusual for a couple to have never seen each other before their wedding day. More and more couples are breaking from the tradition of arranged marriage and marrying out of love. Educated couples get married relatively late, often in their late 20s.
 
Marriage is a civil contract rather than a religious sacrament in Islam, and the parties to the contract represent the interests of families rather than the direct personal interests of the prospective spouses. A marriage must be entered into with the full and free consent of both individuals. Under Islamic law a marriage cannot be validated without the consent of both the bride and groom. After this consent is obtained, preparations are made for the wedding festivities
 
Of the total population in 1981, an estimated 34 million were married. A total of 19 million citizens of marriageable age were single or had never married, 3 million were widowed, and 322,000 were divorced. Although the majority of married men (10 million) had only one wife, there were about 580,000 households, between 6 and 10 percent of all marriages, in which a man had two or more wives.

Bengali marriages have traditionally been arranged with customs dependent on whether the families involved were Muslims or Hindus. For example, polygamy is allowed and marriages between cousins are fairly common among Muslims while polygamy is discouraged and matrilineal cousin marriage are forbidden among Hindus.
 
The divorce rate among Muslims is generally higher because divorces are easier to obtain. The remarriage rate among widows and widowers is much higher among Muslims. Islam does not discourage widow remarriage like Hinduism does.

Typical spouses knew each other only slightly, if at all, before marriage. Although marriages between cousins and other more distant kin occurred frequently, segregation of the sexes generally kept young men and women of different households from knowing each other well. Marriage functioned to ensure the continuity of families rather than to provide companionship to individuals, and the new bride's relationship with her mother-in-law was probably more important to her well-being than her frequently impersonal relationship with her husband.

The society is patriarchal in nearly every area of life, although some women have achieved significant positions of political power at the national level. For ordinary women, movement is confined, education is stressed less than it is for men, and authority is reserved for a woman's father, older brother, and husband. Men are expected to be the heads of their households and to work outside the home. Men often do the majority of the shopping, since that requires interaction in crowded markets. Men spend a lot of time socializing with other men outside the home.
 
Arranged marriages are the norm. It is estimated that 80 percent of all marriages in South Asia are arranged by the bride and groom's parents. According to a favorite expression: The wedding comes first, then the romance.
 
In Bangladesh, parents ordinarily select spouses for their children, although men frequently exercise some influence over the choice of their spouses. In middle-class urban families men negotiate their own marriages. Only in the most sophisticated elite class does a woman participate in her own marriage arrangements. Marriage generally is made between families of similar social standing, although a woman might properly marry a man of somewhat higher status. Financial standing came to outweigh family background in the late twentieth century in any case. Often a person with a good job in a Middle Eastern country was preferred over a person of highly regarded lineage. [Source: James Heitzman and Robert Worden, Library of Congress, 1989]
 
One man told the Washington Post, "The people who love us the most, our mothers and fathers, aunties and uncles, pick someone they feel will match our spirit and complement us. They know us best and want our happiness...Then, once we are married, we have the whole community of family that wants the marriage to succeed. They are there to help the couple, to listen, to be sympathetic."
 
Another man told the Washington Post, "Our romance starts after we get married and begin to find out all these wonderful things about each other. I come home from work and the woman I will spend the rest of my life with is there. We sit down to dinner and learn about each other. She likes roses. She likes to read. Who is this woman? I tell you, it is very exciting."
 
Polygamy and civil polygamous marriages are legal in Bangladesh but restricted according to a law of 1961. The practice has reportedly declined in recent decades but still an estimated 10 percent of Bangladeshi men are in polygamous marriage, though this rate is lower than that found in other nations where polygamy is permitted. Some cities have placed relatively high taxes on extra wives that become increasing higher with each new wife the man takes. A Bangladeshi Muslim man can marry up to four wives, as long as he has the permission of existing wives, in accordance with Bangladesh and Muslim law. There is no known limit to how many wives a Hindu man can take in Bangladesh even though Hindu family law regards polygamy as a sin. [Source: Wikipedia]
 
In many cases, whether through social and familial pressure or through financial dependence, a woman is compelled to agree to something that goes against her own happiness. Some of our laws have also given unfettered power to men over women, and resulted in the worst possible outcome, affecting the most vulnerable sectors of society.
 
Polygamy is a very disrespectful and unjust practice that has historically been a part of many societies around the world, but has declined over time. In modern Bangladesh, there are only a few rural areas where polygamous marriages are still in practice, but in urban areas the practice has drastically fallen. It is gratifying to see that though polygamous marriages are legal in Bangladesh, the percentage is much lower than the average rates found in other Eastern Mediterranean and African countries.
