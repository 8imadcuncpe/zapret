So I want to pick which updates I installed, like Windows 7 allowed. (Also their penchant for rearranging and hiding options and settings is super annoying - sorry one more rant)
 
The insider program pushes new stuff down on the user, and will eventually end up mutating your machine into a Windows 11 OS. And as those things are slowly installed, there is no way to get rid of them.

Then, the ISO you downloaded was a Windows Insider ISO in the first place. Windows Insider isn't an "option" while installing from a regular Windows ISO (and it also doesn't matter if your Microsoft Account has joined Insider, since this is a per-computer settings.)
 
The only polices you currently have configured, is that Windows will notify you of Windows Update downloads and you have configured Automatic Windows Update. If you want to remain on Windows 10 22H2 until it's no longer supported and replaced with a version that is supported, you will want to enable the following group polices:
 
Worth pointing out, cumulative updates released for Windows 10 22H2 will still be automatically installed, as the group polices you have enabled will not block them from being installed. The polices I have suggested will only allow you to remain on Windows 22H2 until it's no longer supported.

This is partially inaccurate. A Windows 10 machine opted into the Insider Preview program absolutely would not result in your machine being upgraded to any Windows 11. At this time, upgrading to Windows 11 is optional, and configuring ProductVersion to "Windows 10" would allow you to remain on Windows 10 until it was no longer supported.

I downloaded the trail version of Parallels 17. That installed flawlessly, and offered to download a version of Windows 11. It had to have been the Windows 11 Home Insider Preview as nothing else would have worked.
 
Here is my question. as it is an Insider Preview, how long can I run it? I mean, I will have to pay for the Parallels software but the Insider Preview is free. So as long as I keep updating it to the latest build, will it keep right on ticking or will it stop working eventually? I would be quite happy to run the Insider Preview as long as I can as long as it is not a security risk and as long as it does not crap out after a month.
 
the reality is I intend to use Windows very very rarely. there are only a few pieces of software that I cannot run natively on the Macbook Air. ( tax software, Financials like quicken, etc,) so I went with the Macbook Air first and will worry about Windows later.
 
sure, but existing users of Macbooks with M1 cpus will have encountered this already and likely already have the answer. I was availing myself of this friendly forum where people actually answer questions instead of pontificating on whose responsibility the topic is.
 
I think if I wanted to know the terms of a Microsoft license I would look on the Microsoft site rather than hoping someone may have run across the same situation. I was trying to provide you the mechanism for getting the correct answer as quickly as possible. But you are welcome to wait for someone to stop by who knows the terms of Microsoft's licensing agreements.
 
Microsoft and Apple do not work well together and I would rather get my information from the Apple side as they tend to be more forthcoming and not so hard to deal with. and to be honest, I trust a Mac user a lot more than a windows site
 
In my experience, Insider Previews can indeed time out, but as long as you're on the latest updates, you should be fine. I had a Windows 10 ARM VM that I used earlier, and when I tried to start it up after Windows 11 was released, I got a lot of notices telling me that I had to update and that the copy of Windows was no longer supported.
 
I'm not sure if Microsoft is going to be making an ARM version of Windows available to the public for licensing, but if they are, I definitely hope Apple will use it to bring back Boot Camp Assistant.
 
Also, I'm not sure if the Insider Preview copy of Windows is actually free. Sure, you can download it for free, but that's also true for production copies of Windows. Once Windows is up and running, the EULA might require you to purchase a Windows 11 Pro license to activate Windows (since that's the version of Windows that gets installed by Parallels by default).
 
I read somewhere on the Microsoft site that the Windows 11 version would not expire until sept 2022 which seems like a really long time. the wording they used however said "as long as you keep it updated" if possible, I would like to run the Insider Preview version until they come out with an official build that you can purchase once and for all, but my understanding is that will not be for a while because of an exclusive deal Microsoft had with Qualcomm
 
I don't mind purchasing Parallels 17, and I suppose an official license for Windows 11. But I want to know that in the meantime the Insider Preview will work as is and that eventually Microsoft will distribute an official version that is not an Insider Preview. \
 
For me, it wasn't truly a time out - rather, the preview expired because it was an older version (Windows 10), and a newer version was available (Windows 11). I don't think there are any time out limitations on the Insider Preview, as long as it remains updated.
 
Parallels says, "Go ahead and we will help you use it". VMware on the other hand will not support any Windows ARM developer preview version in their upcoming virtualization products as thy interpret the EULA as saying it is illegal.
 
I don't see Microsoft firing up any lawsuits against Parallels, but since the ARM version is not a commercial product and just an experiment at this time, it is probably not worth their time, at the moment. Also, rumors have it that MS is currently not even considering releasing an ARM Windows and may never. Unless a big player in the PC market decides to shift to ARM, I don't see Microsoft going much further with Windows on ARM.
 
This build, for those with Windows 11 version 24H2, gradually rolls out a wide variety of new features, including pinning apps to the taskbar by dragging and dropping items directly to taskbar from the pinned section in the Start menu, using your mouse to drag files between breadcrumbs in the File Explorer address bar, and directly sharing to specific Microsoft Teams channels and group chats in the Windows share window.
 
This build introduces the ability to duplicate a tab by right-clicking it in File Explorer. In addition, if you use the **netsh wlan show networks** command, you should be able to read SSIDs that are UTF-8 encoded. This means that Wi-Fi SSIDs with Unicode characters (like emojis) should be properly displayed in netsh output. This change is just beginning to roll out, so not all Insiders in the Canary Channel will see it right away.
 
In this build, those in the Dev Channel who have turned the toggle on to receive the latest updates can now pin apps from the Start menu to the taskbar by dragging and dropping items directly to taskbar from the pinned section in the Start menu.
 
Everyone in the Dev Channel gets a variety of bug fixes, including for one in which some Insiders saw a bug check with error KERNEL\_SECURITY\_CHECK\_FAILURE, and another in which Settings > System > Power & Battery had duplicate text when showing a warning about a slow charger.
 
In this build for Windows 11 version 23H2, those in the Beta Channel who have turned the toggle on to receive the latest updates can get quick access to files that have been shared with you. If you are signed into Windows with your Microsoft account, you will be able to view files that have been shared with your account, such as email, Teams chat, etc. If you are a commercial customer who is signed in with your Microsoft Entra ID account, you will additionally be able to view files that they have shared with others. You can access this feature by launching File Explorer Home and clicking on the Shared tab item.
 
In addition, those in the Beta Channel who have turned the toggle on to receive the latest updates can access Studio Effects in Quick Settings from the system tray of the taskbar. Note that this is being gradually rolled out and so is not yet available to everyone.
 
In this update, you can drag apps from the Pinned section of the menu and pin them to the taskbar, and when you right-click a tab in File Explorer, you have the choice to duplicate it. Note that these features and several others might not be available to all users because they will roll out gradually.
 
Several bugs have been fixed, including one that caused colors in the Performance section of Task Manager to not display correctly in dark mode, and another in which Settings > System > Power & Battery had duplicate text when showing a warning about a slow charger.
 
In this build, those in the Beta Channel who have turned the toggle on to receive the latest updates get some minor changes to simplify the Windows share window, including removing the search box. In addition, the preview thumbnail title in the taskbar, Alt + Tab, and Task View for File Explorer windows will now indicate if that window includes multiple tabs.
 
Those in the Beta Channel who have turned the toggle on to receive the latest updates get a number of bug fixes, including some addressing accessibility issues where File Explorer, Common File Dialog (CFD), and Browse/Shortcuts Dialogs did not respon
