But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart of it is inclusivity, Veilguard game director Corinne Busche tells me before letting me guide her through creating my own character.

As is usual, there are four races to choose from: Elves, Qunari, Humans, and Dwarves. After selecting Qunari, Busche pages through various presets, explaining the game allows for more detailed looks at each and the ability to choose pronouns with she/her, he/him, and they/them separately from gender, select different body types, and more. You can view your character, referred to as Rook in-game, in four different lighting scenes at any time, including The Veilguard's keynote purple hue, a bright and sunny tropical day, and a gothic night.
 
I joke with the team that after spending upwards of an hour creating my Dragon Age: Inquisition character in 2014, I immediately restarted the game after seeing him in the first cutscene; the in-game lighting made my hair color look terrible amongst other issues I had with my Inquisitor. Veilguard creative director John Epler says the team is aware of countless stories like that with Inquisition and its green-hued character creator, adding BioWare worked hard to squash that concern in Veilguard.
 
Head and body presets can be selected individually and customized to your liking with 40 different complexions that include smooth, rugged, youthful, and freckled skin tones, skin hues ranging from cool to neutral to warm, undertones to those skin tones, and even a melanin slider. Busche tells me BioWare relied on consultation to represent all people authentically. There's a Vitiligo slider (where you can adjust the intensity and amount of it) and sliders for your forehead, brow, cheeks, jaw, chin, larynx, and scalp. You can select your undergarments, with nudity as well because "this is a mature RPG," Busche adds, and use the "Body Morpher" to select three presets for each corner of a triangle and then move a cursor within it to morph your body or head into a mix of these presets. It's an impressive technology I'd like to see adopted in other games.
 
I can keep going: You can adjust height, shoulder width, chest size, glute and bulge size, hip width, how bloodshot your eyes are, how visible cataracts are, the sclera color, how crooked your nose is, how big its bridge is, the size of nostrils and the nose tip, and there are as many sliders, if not more, for things like Rook's mouth and ears. On ears alone, I see you can adjust asymmetry, depth, rotation, earlobe size, and even add cauliflower ear to your Rook. Busche says makeup blends modern stylings with the fantasy of Dragon Age with more than 30 options, including eyeliner intensity, color, glitter, eye shadow, lips, and blush.
 
Tattoos are just as customizable alongside options for scars and paint. Tattoos, scars, and paint are very culturally relevant to some lineages, BioWare tells me, with unique tattoos for elves, for example. You can add tattoos to Rook's face, body, arms, and legs, and you can adjust things like intensity, too.
 
Im most impressed, however, by the hair options on display; there are a ton, and as someone with long hair, I'm especially excited about the fun selections I can make. You can finally dye your hair with non-traditional colors, and it's gorgeous. EA's Frostbite engine uses the Strand system to render each style fully with physics. "The technology has finally caught up to our ambition," Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes says.
 
"Rook ascends because of competency, not because of a magical McGuffin," BioWare core lead and Mass Effect executive producer Michael Gamble tells me in contrast to Inquisition's destiny-has-chosen-you-characterization.
 
Ready to begin our Rook's journey, we select a first and last name and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine options. There's a pitch shifter for each voice, too, allowing you to tweak it to your liking further.

The Character Creator aims to provide a fun and easy way to help you find a look for **your** characters. Just like the japanese kisekae (electronic paper dolls), you pick and choose items from a list to ornate your character with. It is free to use and will always remain free to use. For storytellers looking for spritesheets of their characters, we offer those services on demand.

**Question:**
Is Character Creator good enough for a start ? I will only create human characters, no monsters or anything else.
I know they can export to Unreal, but should I just export to Unreal or should I polish it a bit better in Blender or any other tool like that ?
Can you name any popular game that uses Character Creator 3 ?
 
For character development working at the metal level I would highly recommend Daz Studio by Daz3d and make use of the Genesis framework which now has direct support with in Unreal 4 via the use of a plugin bridge, for that matter there is a bridge for most popular 3d applications and game engines, and for the team looking to add AAA type character model support is a logical choice from just all of the base tools being free use. Best of all the bridges are open sourced so as a replacement for the Epic base rig falls with in the fair use licensing as present with the Unreal 4 engine.
 
With out sounding like an add our team started using Daz Studio and Genesis since 4.0 as a development tool and with constant improvement over time has become our preferred tool for character models development that is available by everyone on our team with out the additional seat license.
 
Although Daz Studio is free, I noticed that to make it easy to use a few plugins would be necessary like the Head/Face Morph(200 Plus Head and Face Morphs for Genesis 8 Female(s) | Daz 3D). Which commercial plugins do you think is a must for creation with Daz ?
 
For the animation I guess I will go with the IClone indeed, now it is just a matter to decide if I should go with CC3 or Daz for the character.
As I said, I have no experience with this so I would like the easiest tool, as you are already very knowledgeable with Daz, do you think you would be as fast with CC3 or not really ?
I did a quote with all the addons I think I need for CC3:
 
When we left our hour-long preview of Dragon Age: The Veilguard at Summer Game Fest, my colleague Eric Switzer turned to me and asked "why did they spend so long on the character creator, is it that big a deal?". I just laughed. The dev spent 15 minutes building their Rook, and if they'd spent the whole hour it still wouldn't have been enough. I'm surprised at BioWare's choice not to show it off as part of its gameplay showcase, but from what I've seen it might be the new peak of character creators in gaming.
 
This is a title that Dragon Age has held before. In 2014 when Inquisition dropped, it featured a level of detail that made it the best in the world. Though some technical advances have seen others surpass it since, BioWare has what it takes to rule the world. From the character creator at least, The Veilguard might pull it back to the top.
 
First, the technical side of things. BioWare was keen to highlight the hair strand technology that looked very similar to that seen in FIFA and EA FC, also made under EA's roof. Though we didn't dwell in too many of the fine tuning sliders that allowed for microscopic adjustments of nose angles, it was clear that a lot of options exist to get the smallest possible body parts exactly right.
 
Speaking of smallest possible body parts: your penis (I raise my eyebrows and gnash on my cigar). I take considerable issue with Cyberpunk 2077 being labelled the world's first trans character creator, for a few reasons. Firstly, it's not. Many character creators prior to it allowed for pronoun choice, while it's my firm belief that my character is trans simply by virtue of me saying so. My FemShep? Trans. My Hawke? Trans. My De Sardet? Trans. My Lambo? Blue.
 
But I understand what people mean when they talk about Cyberpunk 2077's trans character creator. As with most discussions with trans people, it is reduced entirely to the genitals. Cyberpunk 2077 let you customise your penis (or, to a much lesser extent, your vagina), and did not limit the body types these organs could be attached to. Undoubtedly, this is highly progressive and I'd rather it was there than wasn't. For a game as huge as Cyberpunk 2077 to let you be trans marks a major milestone.
 
Unfortunately, it's a milestone that's as much a millstone. It pigeonholes this depiction of transness as genitals alone, in a highly sexualised world that was most famously characterised by a female supermodel with a giant veiny bulge at her crotch asking you to Mix It Up while selling energy drinks. It encourages fetishisation, not to mention that subsequent sex scenes will ignore your genital choice - Judy's scene, for female players only, heavily implies you have a vagina while Panam's, for mal
