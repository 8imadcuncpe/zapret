Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first be granted a visa. Either a nonimmigrant visa for a temporary stay, or an immigrant visa to permanently move to the United States. Exchange visitor (J) visas are nonimmigrant visas for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programs in the United States.
 
There are several steps to apply for a visa. The order of these steps and how you complete them may vary by U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Please consult the instructions on the embassy or consulate website.
 
You should generally schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country where you live. You may schedule your interview at another U.S. Embassy or Consulate, but be aware that in some cases it may be more difficult to demonstrate that you qualify for a visa outside of the country where you live. Wait times for interview appointments vary by location, season, and visa category. **You should apply for your visa early.**Review the interview wait time for the location where you will apply:

- **Fees - Pay the non-refundable visa application fee** if you are required to pay it before your interview. If your visa is approved, you may also need to pay a visa issuance fee, if applicable to your nationality. Fee information is provided below:

- Review the instructions available on the website of the embassy or consulate where you will apply to learn more about fee payment.
- **NOTE**: U.S. government sponsored exchange visitor (J visa) applicants and their dependents are not required to pay application processing fees if participating in a Department of State, a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), or a Federally funded educational and cultural exchange program which has a program serial number beginning with G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-7 printed on Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status. U.S. government sponsored exchange visitor (J visa) applicants and their dependents are also not required to pay applicable issuance fees.

Legal Rights and ProtectionsYou must read the Legal Rights and Protections pamphlet to learn about your rights in the United States and protection available to you. Review this important pamphlet before applying for your visa.
 
Evidence of your employment and/or your family ties may be enough to show your reason for travel and your intent to return to your home country. If you cannot cover all the costs for your travel, you may show evidence that another person will cover some or all costs for your travel.
 
After your visa is approved, you may need to pay a visa issuance fee (if applicable). You will also need to make arrangements for your passport and visa to be returned to you. Review the visa processing times to learn more.

A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport or land border) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port of entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.
 
After you present your passport, visa, and DS-2019 at the port-of-entry, a CBP official will make this decision. Once you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.
 
Learn about procedures for students (with F or M visas) or exchange visitors (J Visas) entering the United States on the CBP website under Arrival Procedures for Students or Exchange Visitors. Visit the CBP website to find out about entering the United States. Learn about rules, restrictions, and what food and agricultural products are restricted. You can also find information about other goods that are restricted or prohibited.
 
Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, anyone are out of status will have thier visa automatically voided (Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act). Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status is not valid for any future travel to the United States.
 
If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you receive a job offer), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more.
 
While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa. However, once you depart the United States, you must apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.
 
Exchange visitors are not permitted to enter the United States earlier than 30 days before their program start dates. If you want to enter earlier than 30 days, you must separately apply and qualify for a visitor (B) visa.
 
After you are admitted to the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in visitor (B) visa status, you must separately apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a change of status to exchange visitor (J) status. You must apply and be approved prior to the start of your exchange program. You will not be permitted to begin your exchange program until the change of status is approved. Alternatively, you may depart the United States and re-enter on your exchange visitor (J) visa.
 
There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons to participate in exchange visitor programs in the United States. The J-1 visa is for educational and cultural exchange programs designated by the Department of State.
 
Citizens of Canada and Bermuda may enter the United States as exchange visitors without a visa. They must present a valid DS-2019 form at the border or airport for admission. For more information see information for Citizens of Canada and Bermuda.
