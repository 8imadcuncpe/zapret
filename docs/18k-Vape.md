An **electronic cigarette** (**e-cigarette**) or **vape**[note 1][1] is a device that simulates tobacco smoking. It consists of an atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank. Instead of smoke, the user inhales vapor.[2] As such, using an e-cigarette is often called "**vaping**".[3] The atomizer is a heating element that vaporizes a liquid solution called e-liquid,[4] which quickly cools into an aerosol of tiny droplets, vapor and air.[5] The vapor mainly comprises propylene glycol and/or glycerin, usually with nicotine and flavoring. Its exact composition varies, and depends on several things including user behavior.[note 2]

Nicotine is highly addictive.[9][10][11] Users become physically and psychologically dependent.[12] Scientists do not know how harmful e-cigarettes are over the long-term[13][14] because it is hard to separate the effects of vaping from the effects of smoking when so many people both vape and smoke.[note 4][15] E-cigarettes have not been used widely enough or for long enough to be sure.[16][17][18]
 
Vaping is likely far less harmful than smoking, but still harmful.[19][20][21] E-cigarette vapor contains fewer toxins than cigarette smoke, at lower concentrations. The vapor contains traces of harmful substances not found in cigarette smoke.[21] E-cigarettes containing nicotine are more effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation.[22][23] However, e-cigarettes have not been subject to the same rigorous testing that most nicotine replacement therapy products have,[24] and health warnings may encourage a smoker to quit vaping.[25]
 
E-cigarettes have evolved over time, and the different designs are classified in generations. First-generation e-cigarettes tend to look like traditional cigarettes and are called "cigalikes".[27][28] Second-generation devices are larger and look less like traditional cigarettes.[29] Third-generation devices include mechanical mods and variable voltage devices.[27] The fourth-generation includes sub-ohm tanks (meaning they have electrical resistance of less than 1 ohm) and temperature control.[30] There are also pod mod devices that use protonated nicotine, rather than free-base nicotine found in earlier generations,[31] providing higher nicotine yields.[32][33]

The mixture used in vapor products such as e-cigarettes is called e-liquid.[34] E-liquid formulations vary widely.[28][35] A typical e-liquid is composed of propylene glycol and glycerin (95%) and a combination of flavorings, nicotine, and other additives (5%).[36][37] The flavorings may be natural, artificial,[35] or organic.[38] Over 80 harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde and metallic nanoparticles have been found in e-liquids at trace quantities.[39] There are many e-liquid manufacturers,[40] and more than 15,000 flavors.[41]
 
Many countries regulate what e-liquids can contain. In the US, there are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compulsory manufacturing standards[42] and American E-liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA) recommended manufacturing standards.[43] European Union standards are published in the EU Tobacco Products Directive.[44]
 
Since entering the market around 2003, e-cigarette use has risen rapidly.[45][46][47] In 2011 there were about 7 million adult e-cigarette users globally, increasing to 68 million in 2020 compared with 1.1 billion cigarette smokers.[48] There was a further rise to 82 million e-cigarette users in 2021.[49] This increase has been attributed to targeted marketing, lower cost compared to conventional cigarettes, and the better safety profile of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco.[50] E-cigarette use is highest in China, the US, and Europe, with China having the most users.[6][51]
 
There are varied reasons for e-cigarette use.[6] Most users are trying to quit smoking,[53] but a large proportion of use is recreational or as an attempt to get around smoke-free laws.[6][7][54][53] Many people vape because they believe vaping is safer than smoking.[55][56][57] The wide choice of flavors and lower price compared to cigarettes are also important factors.[58]
 
The gateway hypothesis is the idea that using less harmful drugs can lead to more harmful ones.[60] Evidence shows that many users who begin by vaping will go on to also smoke traditional cigarettes.[61][62][63][64] People with mental illnesses, who as a group are more susceptible to nicotine addiction, are at particularly high risk of dual use.[65][66]
 
However, an association between vaping and subsequent smoking does not necessarily imply a causal gateway effect.[67] Instead, people may have underlying characteristics that predispose them to both activities.[68][69] There is a genetic association between smoking, vaping, gambling, promiscuity and other risk-taking behaviors.[70] Young people with poor executive functioning use e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and alcohol at higher rates than their peers.[71] E-cigarette users are also more likely to take both marijuana and unprescribed Adderall or Ritalin.[72] Longitudinal studies of e-cigarettes and smoking have been criticized for failing to adequately control for these and other confounding factors.[73][74][75]
 
Smoking rates have continually declined as e-cigarettes have grown in popularity, especially among young people, suggesting that there is little evidence for a gateway effect at the population level.[68][69] This observation has been criticized, however, for ignoring the effect of anti-smoking interventions.[76]
 
Most young e-cigarette users have never smoked,[84] but there is a substantial minority who both vape and smoke.[85] Many young people who would not smoke are vaping.[86][54] Young people who smoke tobacco or marijuana, or who drink alcohol, are much more likely to vape.[87][88] Among young people who have tried vaping, most used a flavored product the first time.[87][89]
 
Vaping correlates with smoking among young people, even in those who would otherwise be unlikely to smoke.[90] Experimenting with vaping encourages young people to continue smoking.[91] A 2015 study found minors had little resistance to buying e-cigarettes online.[92] Teenagers may not admit to using e-cigarettes, but use, for instance, a hookah pen.[93] As a result, self-reporting may be lower in surveys.[93]
 
More recent studies show a trend of an increasing proportion of young people who use e-cigarettes. In 2018, 20% of high school students were using e-cigarettes. In 2020 however, this number increased to 50% of high school students reported to have used e-cigarettes.[94] Similarly in Canada there has been trend showing 29% of young people reporting to have used e-cigarettes in 2017, increasing to 37% in 2018.[95]
 
Some of the most common but less serious adverse effects include abdominal pain, headache, blurry vision,[101] throat and mouth irritation, vomiting, nausea, and coughing.[85] Nicotine is addictive and harmful to fetuses, children, and young people.[102] In 2019 and 2020, an outbreak of severe vaping lung illness in the US was strongly linked to vitamin E acetate by the CDC. While it is still widely debated which particular component of vape liquid is the cause of illness, vitamin E acetate, specifically, has been identified as a potential culprit in vape-related illnesses.[103] There was likely more than one cause of the outbreak.[104][105]
 
E-cigarettes produce similar levels of particulates to tobacco cigarettes.[106] There is "only limited evidence showing adverse respiratory and cardiovascular effects in humans", with the authors of a 2020 review calling for more long-term studies on the subject.[106] E-cigarettes increase the risk of asthma by 40% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by 50% compared to not using nicotine at all.[99]
 
The British Royal College of Midwives states: "While vaping devices such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) do contain some toxins, they are at far lower levels than found in tobacco smoke. If a pregnant woman who has been smoking chooses to use an e-cig and it helps her to quit smoking and stay smokefree, she should be supported to do so." Based on the available evidence on e-cigarette safety, there was also "no reason to believe that use of an e-cig has any adverse effect on breastfeeding." The statement went on to say, "vaping should continue, if it is helpful to quitting smoking and staying smokefree". The UK National Health Service says: "If using an e-cigarette helps you to stop smoking, it is much safer for you and your baby than continuing to smoke." Many women who vape continue to do so during pregnancy because of the perceived safety of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco.[107]
 
In one of the few studies identified, a 2015 survey of 316 pregnant women in a Maryland clinic found that the majority had heard of e-cigarettes, 13% had used them, and 0.6% were current daily users.[87] These findings are of concern because the dose of nicotine delivered by e-cigarettes can be as high or higher than that delivered by traditional cigarettes.[87]
 
According to the CDC, E-cigarettes are not safe during pregnancy. "Although the aerosol of e-cigarettes generally has fewer harmful substances than cigarette smoke, e-cigarettes and other products containing nicotine are not safe to use during pregnancy. Nicotine is a health danger for pregnant women and developing babies and can damage a developing baby's brain and lungs. Also, some of the flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be harmful to a developing baby."[112]
 
Harm reduction refers to any reduction in harm from a prior level.[119] Harm minimization strives to reduce harms to the lowest achievable level.[119] When a person does not want to quit nicotine, harm minimization means striving to eliminate tobacco exposure by replacing it wi
