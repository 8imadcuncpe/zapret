I downloaded some mods through the games mod option but cannot find the cbbe mod to get a few skin mods to work. I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to download the cbbe and put it into the games files to work with the game. I'm older so all this stuff is new to me and I'm not even sure where to start. I figured the easiest way to get easy to understand instructions would be to ask y'all. thank you for any help you can give me in making this a simple as possible process.
 
this was the part I figured might be an issue, which is why I was trying to do the modding manually. I had a feeling playing through game pass might be an issue. I got the CBBE.exe file to load and the character can be naked now, unfortunately this wasn't my end goal, I was trying to have my character be able to wear the CBBE lingerie options that are one the F4 pc Xbox mods options, but it still doesn't show up.
