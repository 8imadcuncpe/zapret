Now at all stations that we used that install, we are getting a "Notification" that says "Update Available. Please notifiy your administrator that a new update is available." And the side effect is that saving no longer works. Current version is 2.0.1957 "Active Plan: Student"
 
Thanks for the reply. I have been trying this link but when I login, it only gives me the option to "Get started" on the Fusion 360 card. If I click on this, it asks me to sign back in again, which I do, at which point I get a blank page. This is the case on the latest versions of Edge, Chrome, Opera and Firefox on Windows 10 Education 20H2.
 
Thanks for the reply. This is the process I have been trying - when I click on that link and then select "Class/Lab" and "Get started" on the Fusion 360 card I login to my account and a blank page appears with nothing but a URL at the top
 
I was given a direct link to the Admin Installer on the "How to deploy Fusion 360 to multiple computers" page but this is the older Fusion 360 Admin Install package (v9.20.0.0 which installs client version 2.0.9849). If this could be updated to install client 2.0.10356 this would get us up and running.
 
As for the blank page issue, would you be willing to meet with me to show me what's going on there? I haven't heard about that issue before, and I think it would be helpful to see it. Feel free to email me at .@autodesk.com.

The second script you can setup on a daily schedule and it will query Autodesk and read the version info from the json data (powershell has support for this!) 
You can then use regular expressions to locate the version info in your deploy script and compare the two.
If they don't match then download a newer copy of the admin installer and update the deploy script version number!
 
I'm unable to share the script as its the property of the company I work for, but I hope this gives you an idea on how you can automate the deployment to your computers!

I also record the version numbers to see how often it downloads a new copy.
 
I have already installed the vmware pkg with the windows file, but when I try to open it, it gives me the message: "VMware Fusion requires administrative privileges to perform one-time setup." Is there any way to install VMware without using any admin privileges?
 
Sorry, I'm not actually very adept at any of this "stuff". If someone could offer a tutorial that's easy to follow it would be greatly appreciated. Although I'm having doubts about the plausibility of this in the first place...
 
How would I make use of this code. Also, as the full dmg including the virtual machine was emailed to me by a teacher at my school, I'm not actually sure if I have a license key (which is necessary in the vmware selfservice method.
 
Just wanted to say THANK YOU. I know this thread is like 6 years old, but i have been struggling with patching Fusion and getting around the admin prompt on first launch as all of our users do not have admin rights. This worked perfect with Fusion 12.2.3.

I am trying to install vmware fusion 5-1.0.2 on osx 10.8.2 and it just keeps asking for the admin passoword for the computer. I keep putting it in with no luck. I have installed other programs with no issues.
 
If yours is the only user account on the Mac, it will have Admin privileges by default, so just type your password. Provided the installer is legit (i.e., downloaded from VMWare's servers and not some shady place), it needs Admin privileges since it needs to add stuff in the innermost folders of the OS for virtualization to work.
 
You probably found a something like this already. just make sure you have all the IIS settings setup like the links below.. then check to make sure that isapi extensions are enabled in the handler mappings section of the main IIS server config, not just the website.
 
then try running the web server configuration tool as administrator... right click the link in the programs menu and click run as administrator. remove any current mappings and re-do them. I've found that I had to do it for each IIS web site. I typically will add all my IIS web sites, then use the configurator to map each one individually.
 
It seems like, that you configured the connector during installation. The CFIDE folder is now within your webroot. Can you check if the CF admin url says (default port 80) or :8500/CFIDE/Administratot/index.cfm (internal port 8500).
 
In that case, can you make sure that your CFIDE folder is inside your webroot. Or if it is at a different location, (say D drive in your case), then there should be a virtual mapping created inside your webroot, pointing to your CFIDE folder location.
 
The **CFIDE** virtual mapping gets added during the installation, if internal server was chosen during the installation. The virtual directory points to C:\ColdFusion9\wwwroot\CFIDE. Where as the **CFIDE** is placed within the webroot, if the internal server is selected during installation.
 
Hi,I am installing Cold Fusion 9 on a 32 Bit, Windows 2008 with IIS 7.After the installation, when the Administrator page is to appear, receiving a 404 message.I have added ISAPI Extensions and ISAPI Filters to the the IIS.Also, have added cfm, cfc and cfml to the Handler Mapping for the website.Per the research, the web.config file needs to include the cfm, cfc and cfml?The web.config on the server wit the 404 error has no entry for the cfm, cfc and cfml.I looked on the production server for the web.config file and the file contains the cfm, cfc and cfml.Below is an example entry:
 
I recently encountered the same problem. I was able to get around this by running the installer as admin (right click on the install and it should be an option). You may need to temporarily request admin rights in order to install it.
 
FRAM or the FusionReactor administration manager is installed through the automated installer. It contains the instance manager that will find and configure FusionReactor in your application server for you. This installation approach is used by the majority of customers and smaller environments can be useful.
 
If you wish to run FusionReactor in dynamic environments or move to a more scripted installation, manually installing FusionReactor is generally better. For using the instance manager we have another video that you should watch later.
 
When running the installers, you must do so as an administrator on Windows and a root user on Linux. This ensures the FusionReactor Administration Manager instance can install with sufficient permissions.
 
Once you have read and accepted the EULA you can click next. You then need to specify the installation directory. By default for this windows machine, it will be in the C drive. FusionReactor should be installed on a disk local to the machine, not a network drive.
 
If you are running the setup on Linux at this point you will be prompted to specify which user you want the FRAM service to run as. You should ensure that this user can read, write and execute scripts in the directory of your application server.
 
You will need to access FusionAuth in your web browser. If you have installed FusionAuth on your own system, you will need to know the IP address or hostname of the system where it has been installed. For example, to access FusionAuth on localhost, you would use the following URL :9011.
 
Once you have a web browser open to FusionAuth you will be presented with a setup wizard that will walk you through getting FusionAuth configured and ready to begin calling the API and managing users. If you instead are being prompted by the FusionAuth Maintenance Mode, please complete that setup first and then return to this step. See the Maintenance Mode section in the FusionAu
