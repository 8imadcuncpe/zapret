I'm trying to implement a WebAuthn authenticator with a BLE transport, for a custom authenticator on Android and iOS. However, my research regarding support of CTAP2 authenticator thru BLE support in Chrome has been inconclusive. Although caniuse states that Chrome has full support, Chromestatus seems to state that BLE support was removed from Chrome in 2020.
 
Due to this ambiguity, I'm unsure if I should go ahead with my implementation as I do not want to waste a whole lot of time. Which one of these are accurate? Does chrome has full WebAuthn support (which I presume includes CTAP2 over BLE), or is it specifically missing support for CTAP2 over BLE?

The deprecation only affected Chrome on Mac and Chrome OS. On other platforms (Windows, Android), Chrome interacts with the platform's WebAuthn APIs. You can pair an authenticator to a Windows machine over Bluetooth and it will be available to Chrome.
 
the problem i have is when a mac comes to authenticate again after the timeout period if it is using safari a authentication box appears , they in turn authenticate and continue on. However if they are using chrome on the MAC they just get a certificate error and cant continue. the work around is to open safari authenticate and then chrome is fine.
 
so i guess to cut a long story short chrome is not prompting to authenticate thus i am getting blocked , which in turn gives me the certificate error, and as i am using certificate based inspection, which if a page is blocked a certificate mismatch error occurs and if you procced you get the blocked page.

I want information and update from Asana within a chrome extension developed,
I want to access the API without a token but the browser will recognize the user inside and then allow PUT or GET calls
 
As described in Kerberos for Chrome onAndroid,in Chrome M46 third parties can enable SPNEGO authentication in Chrome forAndroid. To do this they must provide a SPNEGO Authenticator. This pagedescribes the interface between Chrome and the SPNEGO Authenticator.
 
The SPNEGO Authenticator is an Android AccountAuthenticator. As such it mustfollow the pattern described inAbstractAccountAuthenticator.In particular it must implement an authenticator class derived fromAbstractAccountAuthenticator.
 
The interface to Chrome is through the Android account management framework, andin particular throughAbstractAccountManager.getAuthToken.Chrome, inorg.chromium.net.HttpNegotiateConstants,defines some additional keys and values that are used in the arguments togetAuthToken, and in the returned result bundle.
 
WhengetAuthTokenis called the authTokenType will be "SPNEGO:HOSTBASED:" where is the principal for the request. This will always be a host basedprincipal (in the current implementation; future versions may allow other typesof principal, but if they do so they will use a different prefix. SPNEGOAuthenticators should check the prefix).
 
The final result bundle ofgetAuthToken(returned either as the return value of getAuthToken, or through theAccountAuthenticatorResponse)should contain the account name, account type, and token as defined in theAndroid documentation. The token should be Base64 encoded. In addition thebundle should contain the keys:
 
The authenticator can get the uid of the calling app using the KEY\_CALLER\_UIDfield of the options bundle, and then identify the requesting application usingcontext.getPackageManager().getNameForUid() or similar.
 
Chrome defines a number of policies for controlling the use of SPNEGOauthentication. In particularto enable SPNEGO authentication theAuthServerWhitelist mustnot be empty, and theAuthAndroidNegotiateAccountTypemust match the account type provided by the SPNEGO authenticator.
 
In the case of the downloaded **Google Chrome dep** package, once installed using dpkg -i the google-chrome.list is automatically added to the /dev/apt/souces.list.d which will provide automatic checks and updates for newer versions.
 
The most reliable solution to install Google Chrome, important : it has to be the **64-bit edition of Ubuntu** ! (read more about the topic here) ... open a terminal and execute these four commands :
 
In Chrome, every tab is its own process. Yet, logging in to a site, say, Facebook, persists across tabs. For that matter, in many cases, it persists across OS reboots. This seems inherently very very insecure, but I'm just wondering, how is Chrome implementing this? The reboot thing in particular means it is storing something like a session token even after the process is terminated, which allows seamlessly reconnecting, already authenticated, with secure sites.
 
Chrome, like any other browser, is storing a cookie in your file system. Those cookies are what enable you to reconnect automatically to some site. Since it's in your file system, even if you reboot they will still be there. Multiple processes or not is irrelevant here.
 
**No**. Only the page for which the cookie was created can access it. The one that enforces this policy is your browser. If your browser is doing its job correctly then you are ok since it will only send the cookie to the right site (server).
 
You can also access the cookies directly by looking at the file system, but for that you need to have access to the operating system. Webpages don't have access to that hence the browser is doing that job for them and only gives them the cookies they should be able to read.
 
You need to protect your cookies. Stealing your cookies is nearly the same as stealing your password/username. If someone or something, like a virus, steals the cookies residing on your computer, it can impersonate you on that website if you are currently logged in.
 
You will then be logged into that website in firefox as well as in chrome. This is a simplistic version of the hack session hijacking. You could transfer the cookie onto another computer if you want to.
 
There's only one browser process, which manages the tabs, windows, and "chrome" of the browser. This process also handles all interactions with the disk, network, user input, and display, but it makes no attempt to parse or render any content from the web.
 
Each renderer process is run in a sandbox, which means it has almost no direct access to your disk, network, or display. All interactions with web apps, including user input events and screen painting, must go through the browser process. This lets the browser process monitor the renderers for suspicious activity, killing them if it suspects an exploit has occurred.
 
First, in specific to Google Chrome you will find This article very useful. CullenJ mentioned before that Chrome uses processes not threads, but that is untrue. It uses both. According to the article linked above Chrome uses a thread to handle SQlite database operations and gives the example of cookie operations so we can assume that Chrome stores cookies in a SQLite database somewhere.
 
We discourage locking and threadsafe objects. Instead, objects live on only one thread, we pass messages between threads for communication, and we use callback interfaces (implemented by message passing) for most cross-thread requests.
 
Chromium has a multi-process architecture which means that we have a lot of processes communicating with each other. Our main inter-process communication primitive is the named pipe. On Linux & OS X, we use a socketpair(). A named pipe is allocated for each renderer process for communication with the browser process. The pipes are used in asynchronous mode to ensure that neither end is blocked waiting for the other.
 
Within the browser, communication with the renderers is done in a separate I/O thread. Messages to and from the views then have to be proxied over to the main thread using a ChannelProxy. The advantage of this scheme is that resource requests (for web pages, etc.), which are the most common and performance critical messages, can be handled entirely on the I/O thread and not block the user interface. These are done through the use of a ChannelProxy::MessageFilter which is inserted into the channel by the RenderProcessHost. This filter runs in the I/O thread, intercepts resource request messages, and forwards them directly to the resource dispatcher host. See Multi-process Resource Loading for more information on resource loading.
 
Each renderer also has a thread that manages communication (in this case, the main thread), with the rendering and most processing happening on another thread (see the diagram in multi-process architecture). Most messages are sent from the browser to the WebKit thread through the main renderer thread and vice-versa. This extra thread is to support synchronous renderer-to-browser messages (see "Synchronous messages" below).
 
A named pipe is system-persistent and exists beyond the life of the process and can be deleted once it is no longer being used. Processes generally attach to the named pipes (usually appearing as a file) to perform inter-process communication.
 
I also read in one of their documents that they consider subdomains to be the same domain as the root domain for JavaScript compatibility. For example: sub1.example.com, sub2.example.com and example.com are considered to be the same domain by Chrome.
 
Now, I must add here that default cookie lifetime is when the browser closes it expires. So, to support across opening and closing the browser the website must tell it to override this lifetime (which many sites do).
 
Ok, so if a browser overrides its cookies lifetime then it is stored in the database (yes, on the file system) and will be read agai
