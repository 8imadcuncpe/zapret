**Fact:** **Autel MD806 PRO** from auteleshop.com is as the same as Autel MaxiDiag MD808 Pro sold in the physical store. Although they have the different outlook. In another words, Autel MD806PRO can do what Autel MaxiDiag MD808 Pro can do.
 
As a non-professional (a DIYer), you could also consider to have one **Autel MD808 Pro although there are**a bunch of other OBD tools much cheaper available in the market. Especially if you are a geek like me, or are **interested in knowing more about your vehicles like how they run, or just want to have peace of mind when you drive or when you need to clear a code**, I think this may be the ultimate tool for you.

I used **Autel MD808 to do many tests,**ranging from a 10 year old Japanese car to a 1 year old German car. It works like a charm! the 10 year old car has no fault at all ? **I also love the live data, which not only can be displayed as numbers, but also GRAPHS**! As a geek, I really love to see these curves, and I appreciate how much effort they put to make this work so beautifully.
 
My unit came pre-loaded with software version 1.0.
**IMPORTANT:** With version 1.0, I was unable to update via the included USB cord. I had to get a Micro SD Card reader and update the firmware to 1.5. When 1.5 installed I had a new option to update via USB.
