The Instant Client libraries provide the necessary network connectivity and advanced data features to make full use of Oracle Database. The libraries are used by the Oracle APIs of popular languages and environments including Python, Node.js, Go, PHP and Ruby, as well as providing access for Oracle Call Interface (OCI), Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI), JDBC OCI, ODBC and Pro\*C applications. Tools included in Instant Client, such as SQL\*Plus, SQL\*Loader and Oracle Data Pump, provide quick and convenient data access.
 
Instant Client RPM packages for Oracle Linux can now be installed from yum.oracle.com for Oracle Linux 8 and Oracle Linux 7. Older releases are available for Oracle Linux 9, Oracle Linux 8, Oracle Linux 7 and Oracle Linux 6.

Whether your applications are in the cloud or on-premise, you can install Instant Client and connect to cloud databases. Follow the normal installation process for your operating system. Some cloud-specific references are shown below.
 
DigiCert retired the Organizational Unit (OU) field for all public TLS/SSLcertificates to comply with industry standards as of August 2022. This meansthat public TLS/SSL certificates issued by DigiCert will no longer have an OUfield. Refer to MOS note 2911553.1for details.  
  
To avoid disruption to applications connecting to Oracle Autonomous Database onShared Exadata Infrastructure (ADB-S) during the server side certificatechange, you must use hostname based matching of the server certificate.  
  
The following versions of Oracle Instant Client automatically support hostnamebased matching:  
  
Versions: 18.19 (or later), 19.2 (or later), 21 (base release or later), 23.4 (or later)  
- Oracle Call Interface (OCI), Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI) or ODBCapplications must use one of the above client versions.
- Oracle Database drivers based on Oracle Instant Client or Oracle DatabaseClient (e.g ODPI-C, python-oracledb Thick mode, cx\_Oracle, node-oracledb Thick mode,godror, PHP OCI8, PHP PDO\_OCI, ruby-oci8, ROracle, and rust-oracle) must usethe driver with a compatible client version from the list above.
An additional step is required if you have changed the ADB-S connection string.  
  
ADB-S connection strings contain a hostname "...(HOST=xyz)..." which depends onthe region. For example, in the Chicago region the hostname would be"adb.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com". If you have replaced the default hostnamewith an IP address or a custom hostname, then hostname based DN matching willfail. The solution is to add a new entry to your /etc/hosts file using theoriginal ADB-S domain suffix. Your connection string should then use this newname. For example an entry "localtunnel.adb.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com"could be created and used.
 
My configuration works fine on the old version of SQL developer, but in the new version I receive an error when testing the oracle client. My client type is set to Instant Client. See attached. I tried both the old and new instant client as well. Again, the new instant client works fine with the old version of SQL developer, but I get the same error with the new SQL developer and new instant client. Need some help. I am a little stuck right now.
 
oracle-xe is the name of the docker container running my database (from official repo as well).
First I have to say that when I install ping to the docker client container, I can ping oracle-xe. Also I can connect to the database using sql developer from my windows. And from the oracle client docker container if I use this command line it works :
sqlplus userName/password@oracle-xe/XE
 
My problem is only when trying to connect using the tnsnames.ora inside the oracle client container.
Here is my command line to run the client : docker run -ti --network=sai --rm oracle-instantclient bash
when I run sqlplus (without parameters) and after entering username/password I got this message :
ORA-12162: TNS:net service name is incorrectly specified
then if I set the ORACLE\_SID variable (which shouldn't be needed since it's defined in the tnsnames.ora) I got this other error :
ORA-12545: Connect failed because target host or object does not exist

I wanted to try tnsping but it's not included in the oracle instant client and I didn't know where to find it. I tried using the one installed in the oracle database container but it's not working.
I hope someone can help me solve this issue
 
I followed all the instructions, created the PATH and TNS\_ADMIN enivronment variables (set to c:\instantclient\_12\_1, where the Oracle DLLs are installed), I had a few problems with a missing 0x64 DLL (the visual .net distribution mfc100.dll) bundled with the instant client (since this is a pretty much virgin production Web Server, and I have no wish to install anything I don't need), but eventually I succesfully managed to make an ODBC System DSN connect successfully.
 
ERROR [HY000] [Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-12560: TNS:protocol adapter errorERROR [IM006] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver's SQLSetConnectAttr failedERROR [HY000] [Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-12560: TNS:protocol adapter error"
 
This worked a treat, and I was able to connect perfectly. In order to try and drill down to the problem, I run this file as the domain user I set IIS to run as, and it worked a treat with the IIS credentials too.
 
I just installed the 12.2 instant client on linux x86-64. It is a simple unzip with the setting of PATH/LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH pointing to the instant client location. The install location happens to include a glogin.sql. I cannot get sqlplus to call any of the expected \*login.sql scripts at connect time. I have checked permissions. I cannot figure out why it won't execute properly. The only doc I see on here suggests putting settings in the $ORACLE\_HOME location, but as you can see that does not work either. Has anyone seen this or have a solution?
 
For our Oracle connections I use the instant client. This unzips to a directory of your choosing. I then add a reference to that directory in the PATH system environment variable. You will probably have to reboot for the path variable to be added. (or add it manually...)
 
I just want to have GIS Server connections work in ArcGIS Pro regardless of what project I'm in... I'd really prefer for things to just work without having to customize the app / add add-ins but alas that's apparently not a thing
 
The link that you have provided, is for Oracle Instant Client....which doesn't have any standard setup.exe. As Tom mentioned, its a zip file which can be extracted to any location of your choosing and the path added to "Environment Variable" for using it.
 
Asrujit, I downloaded the Instant Client Basic V 12.1.0.2.0. Would this be the correct client? I just read in the ArcGIS Pro help that you can download the Oracle Instant Client from My Esri but I was unable to find it on an Esri site so defaulted to the Oracle site. Thank you for your help.
 
I have an old 32-bit software program that connects to an Oracle database but only works with the Microsoft ODBC driver for Oracle. It does not work with the more up-to-date native Oracle ODBC driver.
 
For clarification, the C:\oracle\instantclient32\_12\_1 directory I specified contains files like oci.dll and ociw32.dll and belonged to the 32-bit Instant Client install. I guess it doesn't matter for 64-bit, since there is no Microsoft ODBC 64-bit client.
 
You are downloading instant client zip files from oracle's product download page and installing to Operating system such as AIX, Linux and would like to get the MD5, SHA hashcode to verify zip file integrity.
Download link such as 

 -client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html
 
Quick aside, the normal way we have this configured in the current setup of VS 2019, VC 7, instant client 19 32-bit is to make a copy of the file orasql19.dll as orasql8.dll this enabled things to work without the need of any extra configuration. Even though the normal recommendation is using a procedure pointer or the initcall directive.
 
Moving to client 19.18 but 64-bit the results are a bit different. At connect we get SQLCODE -1 which should be unique constraint violated, but when running the tests with connection trace activated we can see that no attempt to connect to the remote server is made. The error is internal to the client. A clue is in the error message which is "ORA-00001: unique constraint (%s.%s) violated" i.e an incomplete error message
 
I'm unable to come up with any additional test and will submit at much wordier entry as a support case. But I cannot help to be curious about if anyone else has tried this and found a workable solution.
 
Someone at MF really should write a white paper about how to configure visual cobol and pro\*cobol/instant client ON WINDOWS since today the information is spread out in different forum posts and knowledge base articles. With a lot of it being quite old or for unix/linux. Not the most fun of subjects but one that needs some love and a document that is current.
 
In Procedure division:
 move "PATH" to EnvName
 display EnvName upon environment-name
 accept EnvVal from environment-value \*> After this statement EnVVal will contain the value of PATH at the runtime
 display EnvVal
 
This has really been extensively tested on our side with no success which is why we've opened a case to see MF's opinion on this, plus posting here to see if someone has managed to put together a recipe for VS2022/VC8/Instant Client that actually works.
 
It wasn't clear to me from your response if you checked the value of PATH just before the EXEC SQL CONNECT (using the DISPLAY/ACCEPT code above). For certain with the 1
