They say that money makes the world go 'round, and in **Assassin's Creed Unity**, it's just as true. No, we're not talking about the microtransactions that have turned off some series fans, but the all-too-real need for cash in your pocket to make the most out of the resources at Arno Dorian's disposal. And there are a few clever ways of making it that some players may miss.
 
Given how slim the AAA offerings for Xbox One and PS4 remain, it's a safe bet that more and more gamers will be trying their hand at Unity this holiday season, once Ubisoft has managed to solve much of the game's technical issues (and added free DLC to sweeten the deal). To help those players make the most of their time, we'll offer some tips and tricks to keep Arno's bank account full, and upgrades and customization flowing.

There may be a larger story at play in Unity, but whether running through the streets or across the rooftops of Paris, players will constantly be alerted to a nearby Crowd Event. In previous games, random events like these tended to be time-consuming or frustrating, like chasing down a messenger for endless blocks. Thankfully, Unity's challenges typically require players dispatch a handful of base-level enemies.
 
The individual Events don't bring the big bucks, but once a set level of 15, 20, or 25 is completed, players can receive a bonus of up to 10,000 francs; not a bad reward for what amounts to a few minutes of combat.
 
The fact that an early mission featuring locked doors can be completed just fine without breaking them open may make lockpicking seem like an overrated skill, but it's not. There is no shortage of locked chests (marked in red on the mini-map) scattered throughout Paris, carrying far more cash than their unlocked counterparts. That amounts to bundles of money around every corner that Arno is impossible of gathering, until Lockpicking is unlocked (preferably in Sequence 2).
 
The chests located in the higher difficulty districts of Paris contain an even higher amount of wealth, but can be a bit more challenging to attain. With stronger soldiers prowling the streets (carrying more money to be looted once defeated), it's worth taking a stroll into an intimidating district just to know how much Arno must progress before he can start harvesting their larger supplies of cash.
 
It's just as true that "time is money" in Unity's early stages, where the starter equipment and weaponry is more than sufficient for the tasks at hand. While it's wise to still tackle every Crowd Event as they arise, don't focus too much time on cash until reaching Sequence 3. Besides becoming a legitimate Assassin at that point, Arno is also given access to the Cafe Theatre, located directly above the Assassin headquarters.
 
Once the Cafe is unlocked, put any cash available into renovations. Each renovation brings with it a larger sum stored in the building's account every few minutes, and as the Cafe becomes more successful, more missions are unlocked by speaking with the manager Charlotte Gouze. Fast-travelling back to the Cafe to keep the money rolling in (once full, the account remains maxed out until emptied) can be a bit of a nuisance, but it's a necessary one.
 
The old mechanics of upgrading the city itself returns in Unity, allowing players to renovate Social Clubs located across Paris. With each renovation comes additional missions to further maximize profits, but it's still best to start by purchasing the Social Clubs in the poorer districts of the city, specifically Palais De Justice and Fauborg.

The decision to heighten the French Revolution setting of Unity with interspersed Helix Rifts - time anomalies transporting the player to Paris centuries later - may not be embraced by every player; but for those looking to make fast cash, it's too good an opportunity to pass up. Once players are given an introduction mission to each Rift, the following Data Harvest is the real money-maker.
 
Players who focus on collecting high value data clusters - and rescuing trapped Assassins most of all - will earn several thousand francs almost immediately. Once the Data Harvest is completed, a ghost will be added to guide players to the most efficient paths. Follow it a second time, and a bonus data level will likely be met, adding another lump sum.
 
The addition of cooperative multiplayer gameplay to Unity may have been under-served by the game's troubled launch, but it's worth powering through to unlock the rewards contained within. Specifically, the Heist missions found across Paris - even more specifically, the Ancient History heist, requiring a team of four Assassins to seek out hidden treasure.
 
The bonus rewards are even higher if the mission is carried out without detection (don't bet on it), but it only requires that a valuable item is found in one of four chests scattered throughout an area crawling with enemies. Once it's found, escape with the loot, and earn 25,000 francs - at least. There's no limit to how many times the mission can be attempted, and it's short enough to complete several times per hour - if players are really hurting for the cash.
 
Now that we've passed on some tips on how to acquire the funds needed to tailor Arno Dorian to each player's personal preference, we hope it helps new players enjoy the parts of Unity that really do work. Having a strong cashflow won't fix the technical issues or address narrative criticisms, but it will certainly make the core experience a bit more satisfying.
 
Like I said this is could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you actually play the game. I, personally, find that the way the redid the combat is much better than the last games. Instead of killing all the people by mashing your keys, you actually have to parry and dodge their attacks. Your enemies are much smarter than in the last game and will tend to exploit your weak points during the fight. You also cant immediately block during combat. You have to actually stop fighting the guy you are attacking.
 
Im not entirely sure if stun grenades are in the other AC games but they are in ACU. They do exactly what you think they do. They throw up a smoke cloud and stuns your enemies. Now there is the Smoke bomb too. The smoke bomb just throws up a smoke cloud.
The spears i tend to find incredibly overpowered. They also have a wicked final kill animation. they work kind of like swords only they arnt a sword.
Rifles were also added into the game as a primary. They are a non-lethal weapon and are pretty much a waste of money. I was disappointed with it.
 
If you kill someone that is not in the line of sight of an enemy, the enemies around will NOT come after you.
I.E. you kill a guard behind a kiosk type thing. The guard inside the house nearby will not come after you.
Also you cant move bodies sadly.
 
It is harder to get. Not only that but when you do get money it isnt much. you may get 6-12 coins for looting a dead body and at least 90+ for completing a mission. You may think that isnt so bad right? WRONG! The weapons cost at least 1000 coins for a decent one. Once you get into the higher tiers of the weapons, they start getting up to prices of 15000 coins. Money is definitely harder to come by and nothing is as cheap as they should be.
 
You can buy your hack points (currency) and creed points (currency) if you dont have enough. You can waste up to 100 USD on like 4k hack points and creed points. You know how in app purchases are, well this is like that. Its like they make you buy hack points and creed points to get weapons
 
All in all, i like it even if it has a lower frame rate than i would prefer. I mean on any PC it would be hard to render at minimum 100 entities on screen. I would definitely recommend it to you guys. It seems like they are fixing some bugs here and there but not enough yet.
 
Sounds about right based on reviews I have been seeing. I plan to play this at some point, but will wait for many patches to come out first. SO many problems just running it I hear. Maybe new vid card drivers will fix some of it.
 
I think Uplay is Okay, I guess. I only play it for Trials Evolution, which is actually a really great game. I personally like its relationship with Uplay because if you complete in-game challenges, You can get rewards such as a New level pack or an exclusive Outfit. But it does have its flaws.
 
Borgia messengers are available, but they are not nearly as numerous as in AC2. The most frequent spawn point for them is taking the tunnel to the Thieves Guild, after completing the mission with La Volpe and rebuilding the inn. It would be hugely time-consuming to travel back and forth enough times to get enough money. (The second most frequent point seems to be outside the Isola Tiberina hideout, although it doesn't happen very regularly I don't think.)
 
Your best bet is probably doing your own pickpocketing. The place to do that is the Centro district north of the river; that area has the most people and they are more well-to-do than other areas of the city.
 
The Cento Ochi are good for a fair amount of money, along with sellable items. Be sure to loot them after the courtesan mission, the one where you try to ransom the madam. They're also usually found out in the countryside at night, but sometimes will venture into the city.
 
Locating the treasure chests that have the largest amounts of florins in them might be helpful, although because the map only opens up gradually it could be difficult to find the large treasure chests early enough. Asaic has made maps of the whole city with the treasure chest locations shown. The shop items are listed on the maps, but not the florin amount. If you would like to have the info, I'd be glad to work on mapping the florin amounts in each chest, along with when it becomes available.
 
I lo
