Double backup your photos while tethering. It also supports sending your photos to the server even when the camera is off. Even old Sony cameras (a7, a7r ii) can save the photos to the SD card while tethering now.
 
However, do, consider buying **Campaign Cartographer** if you need to produce professional looking maps of your imaginary world, for example for a self-published role playing project or a Fantasy ebook.

If you are prepared to use this package as a intended, as a design rather than creativity tool, then you can quickly start to produce encouraging results; the learning curve is only a problem if you insist on skiing uphill! My own efforts after an hour of tinkering were not so bad, and would have been better had I been mapping a world that already existed in rough form.
 
Ultimately, **Campaign Cartographer** does require putting in some effort, but for map design, the results are rewarding and learning the software is not a bad way of spending a rainy Scottish afternoon.

I was looking for a waterproof drone because of my job is related to the sea and one of my passion is to make videos of my job that is in sailing boats. 
I am using 3 Gopro 7/8 and 2 Insta360 One R Twin edition but I was missing the drone, that's why I started to looking for and try. Having many years of experience with radio controlled airplanes and helicopters, I can say that my SD3 + named Aquilante flies in a fantastic way. I have tried other drones and I must say that this is the most exciting from the point of view of performance, response to commands, precision, versatility and ease to fly in every mode. I am also very pleased with the possibility of having added loads, for example a GoPro that covers another 100 degrees of vision and/or Insta360. I am still experimenting different cameras configurations and flight techniques for shooting sailing videos and I have to say that the results, thanks to the fly versatility of this drone, are simply astonishing. I am working on a new video using all these assets together.
At the moment I just can say that I am very fulfill by my purchase, money well spent, I am happy thanks to SwellPro's Team and their Boss!
I am just a very satisfied client, I am not paid or sponsored to write nice words. My videos are on Youtube to prove it.

Delivery was slow cause the mail is usually 4 to 6 weeks but it's all good. It's just going to be a waiting game cause of the cold at least -30 to -40 at time until first or second week of March. Just hope this going to be better phantom 3,plus this one has its own monitor and phantom 3 didn't had to use my phone.Anyway I glad I got this waterproof drone will make a big difference. I'll you guys know when I start flying my drone.
 
Scarlet wireless anemometers have been applied to varieties of industries for wind speed & direction monitoring. The risks associated with wind are often underestimated by the public. The Scarlet wind monitoring systems ensure workforce safety and regulatory compliance on cranes as well as other industries.
 
Fast and easily improve your everyday planning and decision making for your farm. You can employ it to measure wind speeds, determine growing locations and areas to erect wind generators. Also use anemometers to collect long term environmental data about an area. Apply our high level technologies to operate efficiently, save on input costs, and improve crop performance and productivity.
 
All construction project and especially high angle construction projects operates under wind risk. Monitoring wind speed and wind direction is a vital issue when it comes to safe operation of construction sites. It is a primary consideration to ensure worksite safety. Severe weather conditions can affect site safety straightforward with wind gusts and high wind speeds posing a deathful threat, especially for construction projects with open envelopes allowing wind to pass through construction projects.
 
Marine ports and terminals liability insurance covers a range of possibilities, including business interruption and losses or damage due to weather conditions. Wind speed direction can significantly affect the position of a ship or oil platform. Regulations require that the vessels record weather data, including wind speed on a regular basis, with data displayed continuously on the bridge. Scarlet offers a complete solutions when it comes to monitoring and recording wind speeds at ports ,harbors and all offshore applications like live wind gust.
 
When people come to play or perform in the great outdoors, the weather conditions often matters to our safety. Accurate wind data is required for both the build and setup process as well as during outdoor events. Monitoring of actual rigging loads, weight distribution and wind speed allows operators to make informed decisions regarding the stability of a structure.
 
Building skyscrapers is a common engineering project nowadays. Changeable climates also matters to workers at the construction site. Strong wind up there while under construction is a big threat for workers and might be fatal. Accurate wind speed and direction are essential in this kind of situation to prevent fall-related tragedy.
 
The wireless module used on wind speed sensors only requires very low power consumption. The transmission power consumes 20-30 uA in normal condition and 35 mA peak current in every 2 seconds. The standard 3.6V Lithium battery can sustain the sensor for up to 3 years.
 
The transmission distance can reach as far as 500 meter in open space. The actual distance depends on the topology & obstacles. According to user experiences, the vertical transmission distance can be 200 meters in height. Harmonic disturbances are possible in theory, but so far we did not receive complaints about this.
 
The address is labeled on the sensor body. User can set receiver address by setting menus. All WR-3 PLUS were paired and tested before shipping. If the text instruction is still not clear, please visit this video.
 
The 2017 medical plans remain Blue Access, Iowa Select and Program 3 Plus, and the premium details haven't changed. Employees will continue to contribute $20 a month for single coverage for these plans. The employee contribution for family coverage remains $20 a month for Blue Access. Family coverage for Iowa Select still is 15 percent of the total premium, and family coverage for Program 3 Plus remains the difference between the total premium and 85 percent of Iowa Select's total premium.
 
University human resources' (UHR) benefits office is hosting a live, interactive webcast on Nov. 2 (9-10:30 a.m.) about the 2017 benefits changes for nonsupervisory merit employees. To participate, log in online, enter your name in the "Enter as a Guest" heading, then select "Enter Room." A link of the recorded session will be available on UHR's benefits bulletin board a few days after the live presentation.
 
The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of dietary supplementation of Omega-3 plus on some the physiological and biochemical traits in growing Baladi goats under hot summer conditions. Thirty-four growing male goats (4-5 months old) were randomly divided into two equal groups. Animals in group 1 were fed a concentrate feed mixture (CFM), which was the control group. Goats in group 2 (the experimental group) were offered Omega-3 plus (1,000 mg/animal day-1) (30% fish oil, containing 18% eicosapentaenoic acid and 12% docosahexaenoic acid + 100 mg wheat germ oil (0.22% tocopherols)) daily in addition to the basal diet for four months (the experimental period) during the hot summer season. Body weight (BW) changes of both groups were recorded monthly during the experiment. Blood samples were collected monthly, and total protein, immunoglobulin G (IgG), total cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes (AST and ALT), blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were estimated. A significant increase in the live BW of growing goats was recorded as a result of dietary supplementation of Omega-3 plus. Total protein, IgG, and T3 levels were higher than those obtained with control. In contrast, total cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, ALT, and AST levels were significantly reduced. The serum concentration of creatinine and T4 levels was indistinguishable from those of control. Addition of Omega-3 plus as a dietary supplement to growing goats under hot summer conditions increases their daily weight gain and improves their general physiological and biochemical status by decreasing total cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, ALT, and AST. It is thus suggested that Omega-3 plus should be used as a supplement in the growth period of goats.
