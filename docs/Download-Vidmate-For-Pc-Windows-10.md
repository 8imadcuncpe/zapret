Windows firewall is pretty good and within our RMM we have automation to notify us if its Windows Firewall is disabled which has worked well. I guess the downside is we cant manage the Windows firewall without a GPO so maybe not the best idea.
 
I've seen an issue with some versions of the Bitdefender firewall where Windows will keep reporting to the user that the Firewall is turned off Users were opening tickets because they were getting popups from windows security. I suggest you run some tests to see if this applies to the version of Bitdefender you are considering.
