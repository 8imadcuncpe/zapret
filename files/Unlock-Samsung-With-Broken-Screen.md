**If your Galaxy phone's screen is broken and you cannot see or touch the screen to operate your device but need to transfer your data, connect your phone to an external display (monitor, TV, etc.) to utilise screen mirroring. You will also need a mouse and keyboard to operate your device so you can transfer your data.**

**Step 1**. Connect a monitor (TV), mouse, and keyboard to the HDMI hub adapter (not included) on your device. Then, hold down the volume up and down button on your smartphone and connect your phone to the HDMI hub adapter. Release the volume button once your phone and the adapter are connected.
 
**Note**: If your phone won't turn on and is unresponsive, or if you have trouble getting the necessary items needed, contact or visit a Samsung Service Centre for further assistance. You may need to bring a phone to transfer the data from the broken device to your visit.
 
Neither Samsung nor Currys appear to want to take any liability for the cracked screen. I honestly only open and close this laptop at home as it is mainly for home use.

Looks like i may have to get it repaired and get stick it out with this product. Completely put off by the brand now and unfortunately after many years of phones and laptops I may have to move away from this brand in the future

I have this problem too, Samsung were useless. Can't quite believe how easily it cracked. I just closed the screen and the crack was on the rhs when I opened it. I am actually dumbfounded that they don't simply swap the thing and say sorry. Have to bring it to Currys now and am told there is a 9 day turnaround and they have to 'inspect' it.
 
Can't believe that this is happening. We just noticed a crack on our laptop's screen as well. Same as someone was describing previously. From under the camera going towards the right. A fine line. We will try to contact Samsung. It seems that this is definitely a fault with this product. We haven't dropped it. I haven't even had it for a long time. It's concerning as I paid a lot of money for it.
 
I am currently facing a tricky situation where my Android phone has a broken screen, and I desperately need to recover the data from Android phone with broken screen. But I am unable to access or navigate my phone's data via the usual methods. And now, I am searching for possible solutions or methods that would allow me to recover data from Android phone using a Windows 11 computer ( I am now using a Windows 11 computer) without relying on the phone's screen.
 
Oh, that sounds like a bummer, but don't worry, there's definitely a way around this! Having a phone with a broken screen is like trying to make your way out of a maze blindfolded, but thankfully, you can get some tools to help guide you through. Here's a couple of methods to help **recover data from Android phone with broken screen.**
 
**1. Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**: This one's a bit techy, but it's a powerful option if you've enabled USB debugging on your Android phone before the screen broke. ADB is a tool that lets your Windows PC communicate with an Android device and execute commands. You can use it to access the device's data and pull the files you need. It requires some setup, including installing ADB on your PC, but there are plenty of guides online to walk you through the process.
 
**2. Third-party Software**: There are several third-party applications out there designed for data recovery from Android devices. These programs can often bypass the need to interact with your phone's screen, though success varies depending on the software and the specific situation with your phone. Just be cautious and look for reputable ones with good reviews.
 
Remember, the best method depends on your phone's current settings (like if USB debugging is enabled) and the condition of your phone. If all else fails, professional data recovery services might be the last resort, but they can get pricey. Good luck, and here's to hoping your data makes a safe journey to your Windows 11 PC!
 
Remember, this process might not work for all devices, especially if they require specific permissions or if USB debugging was not enabled prior to the screen breaking. If ADB commands fail to access your device, you might need to consider alternative methods to recover data from Android phone with broken screen on Windows 11or consult with a professional.
 
For Samsung smartphones, you can recover data from Android phone with broken screen using Smart Switch software. Samsung Smart Switch is a versatile application designed to transfer data between mobile devices and backup or restore data on Samsung smartphones. If you've previously backed up your Android phone using Smart Switch, you can recover your data, including contacts, messages, photos, and more, by following a series of steps.
 
Open the Samsung Smart Switch application on your computer. Once the application recognizes your device, you will see an interface showing your device's details and several options, including "Backup", "Restore", and "Sync". For data recovery, you'll be focusing on the "Restore" option.
 
Click on the "Restore" button in Smart Switch. If you have multiple backups available, you'll need to choose which backup you wish to restore from. Smart Switch will display the most recent backup by default, but you can select a different backup by clicking on "Select a different backup" if you need to restore from an earlier date. After selecting the appropriate backup, click on the "Restore now" button. You may be prompted to allow permissions on your phone again; accept these to continue.
 
The restoration process will begin, and a progress bar will indicate how the process is advancing. The time it takes to complete will depend on the amount of data being restored. Avoid disconnecting your phone during this process. Once the restoration is complete, you might need to restart your device to apply all the changes. After restarting, you should find your data, including contacts, messages, and media files, restored to your device.
 
This happened to me about 2 weeks ago. I search the web and couldn't find anything useful. What I did might seem ridiculous but it did the trick and I managed to not only get my pictures but also exported my contacts and saved them. This is what I did:
 
I connected an OTG cable to my keyboard and pressed the power on button to 'turn on' the screen. I typed the PIN code and pressed enter. Then very quickly disconnected the keyboard and connected the device to my pc (it helps having 2 cables, one with OTG adapter attached and one just with USB). This way I can see the files of the mobile and I can save my photos etc.
 
Right after connecting with the keyboard and typing the PIN code, I took a screenshot (for Galaxy phones you can do that by pressing home and power buttons simultaneously). Then quickly again I would connect it in my PC and go to the screenshots folder and this way I could figure out where I was. It is quite hard at first but this way you can navigate anywhere you like just by pressing the arrow buttons and enter key. If at any moment you don't know where you are, you can take a screenshot. The disadvantage is that until you get to see the screenshot from your PC, the screen locks again and you will have to connect to the keyboard again and repeat the process but this way I exported my contacts, found them through my pc and imported them into my new phone.
 
I ran into a similar problem with an older samsung phone that had the screen lock set as a pattern. The entire touch screen was smashed and touch was not working and connecting the phone to a computer did not help either.
 
My only option was to take it to a repair shop specializing in smart phone repairs and they fixed the phone by putting a new screen on it. It was a bit costly (the price usually varies on how new your phone model is, so newer phones are really expensive to repair, older ones a bit cheaper) but I was glad to pay that amount just to save my media and contacts.
 
I've got a friend who dropped her S7 edge. The glass hasn't broken, but the screen flickers/flashes, to the point where it's hard to look at and almost impossible to use. Given the cost of new LCD units, replacing that isn't looking a likely option. I've taken the back off and disconnected everything in the (admittedly very slim) hope that it could have been a slight loose connection from the drop. When I connected everything back up and turned it on it was still flickering to start with, but after a while it returned to normal. This lasted about 20mins before the flickering started again.
 
I'm guessing the display was damaged when she dropped it and it's not repairable, but thought I'd ask here if anyone has any ideas what might be wrong, and if it can be fixed, before she goes shopping for a new phone??
 
"Try a hard reset. Hold the power button and volume down button until you see the Samsung logo and then let go. Hopefully that will help. If it doesn't I would think then that you have done internal damage."
 
I have an s6 active and I drop my phone, multiple times a day. I have also had a screen flickering problem, only about a half inch on the bottom of my screen flickers, mainly when I use Netflix. Turning down the brightness on my screen makes it stop flickering completely. Hope this helps.
 
I have a samsung s10 and I dropped it and now it makes this flickering glowing box when I turn the brightness up. And I have to keep the brightness low to stop the flickering, but it still appears even at some points
 
Not guaranteed as it is a case by case assessment but a temporary fix with a strike rate of 4 out of 5 edge screens I have come across is to immediately switch of ALL EDGE PANEL LIGHTING AND PANELS. This will also help reduce the stress on a damaged device. F
