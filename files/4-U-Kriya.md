Kriya practice initiates a sequence of physical and mental changes that affect the body, mind, and spirit. There are kriyas to support the liver, balance the glandular system, stimulate the pituitary, and more. Each kriya has a different impact, but they work on all levels of your being at once.
 
*Kriya*is a Sanskrit word meaning complete action, deed, or effort. The root, *kri*, means to do or create. Within the context of Kundalini Yoga, kriya refers to a single or specific set of yogic exercises designed to create a predictable outcome in consciousness. The end result of a kriya is cumulative, and more than the sum of its parts.

The instructions for any given kriya will include the sequence of postures and, if applicable, the suggested time in each exercise, eye focus, and accompanying breath or sound. Kriyas make up the body of most Kundalini Yoga practice.
 
In practice, a teacher or practitioner will select a kriya to work with, which could be for anything from deep sleep to spinal flexibility, from relieving inner anger to radiant skin. A kriya may also support a specific body part or organ. Most involve a particular sequence of postures, sound, and breath techniques.
 
The wisdom of Kundalini Yoga holds that the angles of the asanas, fueled by the breath, re-tuned by the repetition of mantra, and concentrated by the eye focus and body locks, change us at the core of our being. This is empowering for the practitioner, who engages a practice with the potential to create real and immediate change.
 
The general guideline for kriya practice is to follow the sequence as given, except to reduce the timing or modify postures as needed, understanding that our bodies, abilities, and circumstances are unique.
 
When reducing the times for a kriya, the best practice is to cut the times for all exercises in the kriya proportionally. So if you cut one exercise in half, for example, cut all of them in half (the exception is those that only call for one minute, which should still be practiced for the full time). Do not practice for longer than the times recommended.

If you want to work with full times but are physically unable to do certain postures, you can work in intervals or visualize the shape in your mind while performing whatever physical approximation suits your body.

**Over 100 independent studies** conducted on four continents and published in peer-reviewed journals, have demonstrated a comprehensive range of benefits from practicing Sudarshan Kriya.
 
Sudarshan Kriya and accompanying breathing practices, referred to collectively as sudarshan kriya and taught through the Art of Living Foundation worldwide, have been found to enhance brain, hormone, immune and cardiovascular system function. Published research shows that sudarshan kriya significantly reduces stress, depression, anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and significantly increases well-being both mentally and physically. Research also demonstrates that the effects of sudarshan kriya reach all the way down to the molecular level, to our DNA.
 
**In Summary,** Sudarshan Kriya uses specific cyclical, rhythmic patterns of breath to bring the mind and body into a relaxed, yet energized state. Its effects have been studied in open and randomized trials, both in healthy and health compromised populations.
 
More than a dozen published studies have documented significant relief from depression in individuals who learned and practiced Sudarshan Kriya and accompanying breathing techniques. **These studies have demonstrated a 67-73% success rate in relief from depression, regardless of the severity of depression**[1-6].
 
At three months, the individuals remained asymptomatic and stable, which demonstrates results persisted and cannot be considered a placebo effect. [3-6, 11] (Placebo effects in depression wane after 4 weeks).
 
The P300 ERP EEG brainwave pattern and NREM brainwave pattern, which measure electrical brainwave activity and are abnormal in many depressed people, returned to the normal range by ninety days. [4, 5]
 
In a comparison study, sudarshan kriya was statistically as effective as the conventional anti-depressant medication[1] . Yet, in contrast to the usual treatments for depression, sudarshan kriya is natural and free of unwanted side effects. It is self-administered and self-empowering. It can greatly reduce doctor and hospital caseloads, thus making sudarshan kriya cost effective and staff effective as well [3].

A Harvard University health publication describes research on the Sudarshan Kriya's effects on anxiety, stress, depression and over health, saying it "shows promise in providing relief for depression".
 
Operating in 180 countries, The Art of Living is a non-profit, educational and humanitarian organization founded in 1981 by the world-renowned humanitarian and spiritual teacher, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar whose vision is a stress-free and violence-free world.
 
The initial point of entry to the path of secret mantra vajrayana is ripening empowerment, so here one receives the water empowerment, which establishes the potential for ripening into the dharmakaya, and the crown empowerment, which establishes the potential for ripening into the rupakaya. Then one keeps the general samayas of the kriya yoga as they are explained in the particular texts themselves.
 
In terms of determining the view, the basis of the path, one realizes that the ground of purification, the nature of mind itself, is the wisdom of empty clarity, and is ultimately beyond all extremes of elaboration, such as existing, not existing, appearing or being empty. Then one views the aspects of relative appearance, which are what must be purified, as the characteristics of the completely pure deity.
 
In the short term, one becomes a desire realm vidyadhara, and ultimately one attains awakening as Vajradhara of one of the three buddha families: of the family of enlightened body, Vairochana, of the family of enlightened speech, Amitabha, or of the family of enlightened mind, Akshobhya.
 
Kriya simply means method, practice, technique. Having said that, we should understand that there is no technique to find the Truth. However, you can prepare the ground from where it is possible to take off, perhaps. It is a Sadhana to prepare yourself to open your windows so that when the breeze of grace blows, you have not closed your windows and it comes in.
 
**The aim of Kriya Yoga** is to help the aspirant advance towards freedom from the constant fluctuations of a disturbed mind. Regular practice over a period of time aids in peaceful and calm meditation, and ultimately helps to naturally achieve a state of well-being and content, by discovering the source of happiness within ourselves.
 
The Naths were yogis par excellence. The asanas, pranayama, kriya yoga, bandhas, and mudras were practiced and perfected by them.All the important works on yoga, like the Goraksha Shataka, the Gheranda Samhita, the Hathayoga Pradipika, and so on were written by Nath yogis.
 
The basic purpose of Kriya is to balance your breath. The breath (shvasa) is closely linked to your life energy (Prana). So Kriya is the method by which the prana is balanced which is usually dissipated through the 108 nadis (channels).
 
However, to go into the interiors of your consciousness, the mind needs to be clear, free of prejudices and pre-conceived ideas and therefore open to receive. Kriya is one way to harness all the energy that is in you, which is usually dissipated and bring it to one point.
 
You need to gather these energies which are in the Ida and the Pingala, bring them into Mooladhara chakra, make them travel along the Sushumna, from which when the Prana or the energies begin to operate, then your awareness rises from the gross to the subtler and the subtler and finally you touch That, which is endless and cannot be understood by the five senses.
 
**The results of the Kriya**are decided by your dedication, your one-pointedness, and your understanding of what you are trying to do and practice, rigorous practice. All these things count.
