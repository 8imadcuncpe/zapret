I cannot click on these files to "show in finder" Also, I can't highlight them to load them.

Most likely these are some place within one of the Library folders. Spotlight won't give you what's in those folders unless you configure it to show you what's in those locations. Spotlight considers anything within those folders "system files".
 
Also when I search Spotlight for 'Lennar' or 'Sylenth' nothing appears? I've Google researched this and have looked at my System Preferences setting for Spotlight and everything is turned on and there is no Privacy setting on....so..... in theory Spotlight should locate anything but it currently won't fine my Sylenth folder(s).

Jordi thank you so much for pointing that out. I thought the layout had changed! Personally I really can't be bothered to keep updating my operating system when you have to spend so much time afterwards trying to work out how things have changed and how to get them to work again!
 
I wonder if you might know how to solve my ongoing Sylenth problem? I'm trying to load up a session in Logic from an external computer (my mates). He's sent me the project in Dropbox but his Sylenth patches (which are add on patches) won't load up in Logic ( I get a message saying 'Can't read new preset version' on Sylenth's main screen...)
 
.FXP refers to individual synthesizer presets and .FXB refers to the Bank file (where all the synthesizer presets is loaded in for quick use). We would recommend loading a Bank file, but we'll go over both methods here for you. For .FXP (presets)
 
First, load the synthesizer Sylenth1 into your DAW. Once Sylenth1 is loaded simply click on the Menu button and then click Load Bank. After of which, locate the .fxb" in the downloaded folder and it will load up into Sylenth1.
 
After selecting the soundset file and open it, Sylenth1 will have the bank loaded, and you can access all contained presets through the usual preset list window in the top of the display in Sylenth1 user interface.
 
In most cases our products (e.g. soundsets and presets packs) contain a detailed installation guide, if the presets based on the synthesizer, need to be placed in specific folders and of course, which version of the specific synthesizer is required to use the soundset files. Otherwise, the developer`s manual of the synthesizer always shows how it`s own preset handling works and can be used.
 
This means it will also show up in Astra's preset browser automatically - you don't need to do anything else to start using your downloaded presets in Astra. You can open them up through the "from Splice" folder in Astra's preset browser:
 
This means they will also show up in Beatmaker's preset browser automatically - you don't need to do anything else to start using your downloaded presets in Beatmaker. You can then open those presets under the "Downloaded on Splice" section in Beatmaker's preset browser:
 
The file picker defaults to the recommended directory, but you can load a preset or a bank from anywhere on your computer. If you load a bank file, it loads that bank and all of its presets. If you load an individual preset file, Sylenth **overwrites** your currently selected preset in your current bank. From that point forward, that preset is part of its containing bank, and the preset file is no longer required. To load a preset without overwriting anything, you have to select a blank preset slot in your current bank and load a preset through the plugin menu.
 
To load up a preset, launch Spire and click on the "menu" button next to the preset browser. Click "Load Preset (.spf)," and then navigate to your Spire Presets folder in your Splice folder. Select a preset and click "open," to load up an individual preset.
 
To make a preset bank for your Splice presets, first navigate to Menu > Select Bank > init. This will load up a blank sound bank with only "init" presets. Navigate to the menu and then click "Load Preset (.spf)," and then navigate to your Spire Presets folder in your Splice folder. You can then multi-select multiple presets to load them into the current bank. Go to Menu > Save Bank. Give it a title, and then save your sound bank where you want to on your computer. Go to Menu > Import Bank, and select the bank you just created. You can now load up your Splice preset bank (using "Select Bank") so you can browse those presets directly through Spire.
 
If I use main Media Bay, single click selection or mouse keyboard arrow up down does nothing and double click creates a new track instead of replacing the selected one so I have to drag and drop on top of the selected track every time.
 
If I use righ zone media bay, it loads for pre listen the plugin which slows down the process a lot. and there is no way to hide the bottom preview zone unlike the main Media Bay.
Also no way to see a location tree view on Right Zone Media Bay which makes it hard to find stuff easily. For example I have my Kontakt and Sine libraries presets in folder structure LIbrary Name/Instrument Type etc but no way to see this folder structure on Righ Zone media bay. Only tags.
 
This done, I use, in the same location, the Load VST preset one. It opens a kind of simplified Mediabay UI with a major advantage : we only have to click once on the presets list to load one, and yes, the up/down arrow keys also work. Additionaly, on the left pane, the Logical option can be used, more or less like in the full Mediabay window.
 
You have installed babel dependencies like cli, presets, plugins in frontend\_config folder and you're transpiling JSX files which are not placed in same root babel installed. That is why, it shows like Couldn't find preset "env" relative to directory
 
For anyone having this issue, the solution when using Babel 6 and placing node\_modules in a different directory than the project root is to use **absolute paths**. Hence the babel call would look like:
 
The AU is just the same JUCE audio plugin code as the VST (of course using the AU wrapper), and it does show the presets in another AU host such as Logic for example. So this might also be something specific to Live. But then my question is: how do you guys and gals get Live to show your presets for an AU plugin?
 
I've implemented both the get/setStateInformation and get/setCurrentProgramStateInformation member functions of AudioProcessor, and also getNumPrograms, get/setCurrentProgram, getProgramName, changeProgramName.
 
Is there a specific way to let Live know about the presets you're supplying in your AU plugin?
Or maybe I'm just missing another way to deal with presets for AU plugins (although in Logic it's just fine)?
 
@Timur: I don't have an answer to that question. I don't have a working AU plugin built without Juce (and I haven't looked into the AU SDK for direct examples recently). It might actually be good if the JUCE audio plugin demo used more than 1 program and also implemented get/setCurrentProgramStateInformation (now it only has 1 program and only implements the get/setStateInformation calls for the complete plugin state), so we have a working "reference" to try in various hosts.
 
I just found it very strange that Logic does show the presets, but Live doesn't, and was wondering if I might be missing something special regarding Live that is common knowledge (like for RTAS you need to have these .tfx files for your presets in a certain folder in order for ProTools to show them).
 
@ttg: I've always been under the assumption that that's what get/setStateInformation and get/setCurrentProgramStateInformation etc... are for: to make sure all hosts have a standard way of accessing plugin presets, either individually, or all together as part of the whole plugin state.
Your test seems to indicate that there are other plugins that show their presets for the VST and not for the AU version in Live (even though I don't know anything about the internals of that plugin, of course).
 
Is it sufficient to call get/setCurrentProgramStateInformation and read/write the data from/to a file stream from within the GUI thread (like in a button listener callback), or is a separate thread needed to handle this? I don't really care if the GUI freezes while loading/saving for half a second.
