**Gross income** is the total revenues of a company minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). Businesses often use gross income instead of net income to better gauge their product-specific performance.

The profit you make will depend on your business expenses. Keep track of all expenses to make sure you're maximising your business's profits. Making a profit means your business can continue to operate successfully and will be in a good position to grow.
 
There may be tax implications to consider from your decision. Talk to your accountant or business adviser for more advice. Remember to include your wages or salary as drawings in your chart of accounts, if you have one.
 
To make a profit, you must understand what minimum level of sales (also known as revenue or turnover) you need to cover your operating expenses, and to make enough money for your personal commitments.
 
When your sales revenue (the total amount you bring in from sales) exceeds your direct expenses (cost of goods sold), your business has made a gross profit. Gross profit is a valuable measure of whether your pricing policy, volume of sales and cost of goods sold will make your business a profit.
 
**Net profit margin** is your gross profit margin less your business overhead expenses. It's your profit before you pay tax. Tax isn't included because tax rates and tax liabilities vary from business to business.
 
Compare your gross and net profit margin data with other businesses in your industry. You can then work out where you need to improve your operations to keep up with the competition. You can also spot profitability trends that show you where other businesses are catching up.

A profit goal will help you make decisions around your business finances. Your profit goal is the amount of money you need to meet the commitments that are important to both you and to the future of your business.
 
To set a profit goal you must understand your business and what you can realistically achieve. Consider your costs, as well as your **return on capital, return for risk** and **return for future growth** when setting your goal.
 
Return on equity is a useful indicator for how successfully your business uses its investments to generate an adequate return and make a profit. Return on equity is often shown as a ratio (e.g. for every dollar you invest, you generate $1.50 in return).
 
Aim to achieve a fair return on the money you have invested in your business, as well as your salary. Once you've calculated your break-even point, decide what you consider to be a reasonable return on investment given the level of risk, and a suitable salary for the owner or manager of the business (this may be yourself).
 
It's useful to view your minimum number of sales as total number of products you need to sell on a daily or weekly basis. If your business can't generate the minimum number of sales, then you won't meet your profit goal.
 
Expenses are the costs a business incurs from its core operations, while revenue is the money it earns from selling products and services before paying expenses. Once you pay expenses, you get net income or profit, which equals the total revenues minus the total expenses from a given accounting period.
 
Additionally, you can calculate net income using its statement of owner's equity and use the result to calculate total expenses. This post looks at calculating, tracking, and managing your total expenses.
 
A company's total expenses refer to the sum of its costs spent toward running the business. For example, the expected costs of running a SaaS company include salaries, web hosting fees, software subscriptions, hardware repairs, transport, advertising fees, and equipment purchases.
 
A company may have considerable total revenues from its income statement. Then, as you go down the income statement, you start subtracting the following line items to get EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes):
 
Before calculating total expenses, it is critical to know the difference between revenue and income. Revenue is the money earned after selling products or services before paying expenses. Income refers to total profits (net income) after subtracting expenses from revenue.
 
The formula above is helpful for reverse engineering a company's total expenses. However, a detailed breakdown of expenses throughout the accounting period is an invaluable management tool that can help track and cut costs, inform budget decisions, and support project growth.
 
Tracking expenses based on frequency can help you flush out hidden costs such as a software subscription you forgot to cancel. It also allows you to keep separate expense accounts to assist in budgeting and creating better projections.
 
The main reason for this categorization is to determine how a company spreads its spending and compare those ratios to competitors. For instance, a data management company might use this method to discover they spend twice as much on marketing than their competitors do and only half as much on R&D. Consequently, a newer and research-hungry competitor could overtake them soon.
 
It's easier to manage business costs when the business is in its infancy. However, managing total expenses gets more challenging as the business grows because it's harder to watch closely over every dollar spent.
 
It's critical to plan and tightly manage all business expenditures and financial performance. Creating an efficient budgeting process is the best way to manage your operating costs and keep finances in check. It's easier to budget and expense for a small business, and budgeting will mainly entail controlling cash flows.
 
If you have enough accounting resources available, you could use the zero-based budgeting (ZBB) method to plan your expenses. Here, you allocate every dollar towards a business goal. It would help reassess these goals regularly to ensure each cost is necessary.
 
As the business grows, you start planning for new investment opportunities at the appropriate time. It isn't easy to have a hands-on approach with expense tracking and management at this stage. Hence, the need for accounting and expense management software.
 
Whatever expense tracking method you choose, an automated accounting solution can help you figure out where to allocate resources or cut costs. It gives an overview of your financial state and allows you to make informed decisions and develop smarter strategies.
 
Making people accountable for business costs eliminates unnecessary spending. For instance, you could print out your company's credit card statement monthly and identify each charge. You could then use different colors for different categories such as development, overhead, or marketing and tally the data in a spreadsheet to overview where your money is going.
 
Dedicated phone applications for tracking costs and expenses are a great way to stay on top of your finances and track your total expenses. Find bookkeeping software that integrates directly with your phone apps to track and manage expenses when you are out and about.
 
These are the costs spent on running the business. For example, the expected costs of running a SaaS company include salaries, transport, software subscriptions, hardware repairs, web hosting fees, advertising fees, and equipment purchases.
 
Expenses refer to money a business spends to ensure it can function and grow its core operations. Total expenses help calculate the net income (or loss) and evaluate business performance in financial accounting.
 
In order to achieve consistency between on the one hand the national accounts logic (expressed in the sequence of accounts for production, generation, distribution, redistribution and use of income, accumulation and financing) and on the other hand a government budget perspective (government spending and receipts), two additional concepts about national accounts categories are defined in the European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 2010) - government **total revenue** and government **total expenditure**.
 
This alternative presentation to the national accounts **sequence of accounts**, at the core of which is the harmonised definition of total revenue and total expenditure is in many ways better suited to the particular analytical requirements of fiscal analysts. This presentation is commonly called the government finance statistics presentation (**GFS**). Both presentations are complementary, with two tables in the GFS part of the national accounts transmission programme allowing for a full or near full presentation of both concepts. The key balancing item of the GFS non-financial accounts is net lending (+)/ net borrowing (-) or more commonly the surplus/ deficit. It is alternatively derived through the sequence of accounts or through the difference between total revenue and total expenditure.
 
Total revenue is the aggregate of all transactions recorded under resources in the ESA framework, including subsidies receivable in the current accounts and capital transfers receivable recorded in the capital account. Total expenditure is an aggregate of all transactions recorded under positive uses, and subsidies payable, in the current accounts as well as transactions (gross capital formation, acquisition less disposals of non-financial non-produced assets plus capital transfers payable) in the capital account.
 
A **revenue** transaction is one that increases net worth. Revenue is presented in the tables as the sum of taxes, net social contributions, sales (defined a
