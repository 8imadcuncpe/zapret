If you believe your organization qualifies for tax exempt status (whether or not you have a requirement to apply for a formal ruling), be sure your organization is formed legally before you apply for an EIN. Nearly all organizations exempt under IRC 501(a) are subject to automatic revocation of their tax-exempt status if they fail to file a required annual information return or notice for three consecutive years. When you apply for an EIN, we presume you're legally formed and the clock starts running on this three-year period.
 
**Example:** Your organization applies for an EIN in November 2023 and chooses a December accounting period. Your first tax period would end on December 31, 2023, and your first return or notice (if your organization does not meet one of the few exceptions to the annual reporting requirement) would be due May 15, 2024. You would be subject to automatic revocation of your exemption if you fail to file for the three periods that end December 31, 2025 (return/notice due May 15, 2026) or for any consecutive three-year period thereafter.
