I have been using both an Insteon hub and UD ISY994i on my home network for about 5+ years now with many Insteon devices installed. Yesterday, as many of you know, Insteon shut down a large number of cloud servers which caused the Insteon hub to fail and I can no longer control my devices via Amazon Alexa or the Insteon app. As such, I want to use my ISY994i instead, so I downloaded the MobiLinc Pro app for starters. I cannot get the ISY994i hub to connect to the internet as I get a "Failed enabling internet access" error. UPnP is enabled on my router. What am I missing? Goal is to use app and Alexa to gain control back of my devices. The UD Admin console works fine on my laptop and able to control devices, so within my LAN, it's fine.

MrBill - thank you for that info. As you recommended, I subscribed to the ISY portal and while I was at it, I manually updated my firmware from 4.90 to 5.0.16C. Is there a reason why when I try to use the Admin console I can no longer log in as Admin? I get a "Failed. Retry Authenticating" message. I know my username and password are correct - just logged in prior to updating firmware when it was running 4.90. I can now successfully control my devices using the UD Mobile app on my iPhone, but have not figured out why MobiLinc Connect does not work. When I try to register my account, I get a "Failed to Register" error stating "Invalid UUID" but in the ISY UUID field the 12 character code is accurate.
 
To further comment on the remeainder of your post Mobil Connect and the UDI portal are two competing portals and only one can be used at a time with the hardware. Stick with the UD portal at my.isy.io for compatibility with both the UD portal AND mobilinc Pro.

Thanks Javi and MrBill - thanks for the info on the Admin ID and pwd. I didn't see that in the firmware upgrade notes. MrBill - re Portal... I have listed Portal Integration - UDI online and registered. Active Services is also registered. I don't understand the "Mobil Connect portal" statement. Also, even though I added the ISY skill to Alexa and linked my account successfully, Alexa is not recognizing the devices in my ISY account. And my MobiLinc Pro iPhone app is still not working.
 
Note: due to the fact your portal credentials are used, you can't mix in a local connection on the same Profile. You can create multiple Profiles in mobilinc however-- One for your local network using HTTP and one for access via the portal.
 
Thanks, MrBill... I was missing the secure https field and secure port. I did add one of my devices in the myspoken and when I ask Alexa to turn it on or off it replies the skill is not enabled, however, I added the ISY skill and linked it successfully to my account. I even disabled the ISY skill, enabled it and relinked my acct successfully.
 
Actually, I am still having issues with the "UD ISY Optimized for Smart Home V3" skill. Alexa finds the devices and scenes, I have the spoken word to match, Alexa keeps returning "The skill linked with device is not enabled. Please enable the skill to control this device." I keep checking and it is enabled and my account is linked successfully. I have previously removed the Insteon skill to make sure there is no redundency.
 
@JGallombardo You may be experiencing problems with rate limits. Amazon only allows so many API calls per minute, per hour, etc disabling/enabling has been proven to eat alot of traffic. It's more time consuming but I think it's better to delete and rediscover devices and scenes than disabling/reenabling the skill. one of the problems with Alexa is they don't publish some of the rate limiting rules of the API, but it's designed to keep any user from using up all the resources, or getting stuck in a loop.
 
@MrBill thanks for this - didn't know the Amazon API call limits. Another thing I did which helped was I went into my alexa setup ( ), then Smarthome, then Devices and removed everything that was linked via my Insteon hub. I also got rid of any groups that were defined in alexa. I think the better way to go is to create scenes in ISY, now I'm battling with having alexa turn on/off all lights included in scenes.
 
ISY scenes are definitional greater than Alexa scenes! I use Alexa only as an I/O device... all the controller type functions and grouping are done in the ISY. Hint: you can also use programs in the ISY... for example "Alexa, goodbye" could run a program that turns off everything.
 
Max Turbo Frequency 4.90 GHz

This is why I would always get K versions over non-K.
With non-K versions, the Turbo settings are not available in the BIOS, and are internally set to very low time and threshold values. For example, If CPU temp is < 40C for 30 sec, then max Boost time allowed = 20 sec, but if Temp > 70C then Boost start to throttle to avoid the Temp get higher.
I just took random numbers as an example, but the functioning is really close to that, you get the idea.
 
This is related to predictor6 bug in JPEG. In GDCM was a patch to workaround it, it is actually removed (some data set may work better without it, some with, AFAIK), so there is no problem with your data set in current Slicer version (tested with nightly).

I would strongly discourage any DICOM users from using transfer syntax 1.2. 840.10008.1.2.4.70. Due to the Osiris bug, it is handled differently by different tools. It is also very inefficient, and one will typically get much better compression using conventional file based compression (e.g. zstd, zip, gz). Since DICOM only requires DICOM compatible tools to handled uncompressed data, using compressed transfer syntaxes can cause unintended consequences. If you must use a compressed transfer syntax I would suggest the more efficient, modern and consistently implemented 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.80 (JPEG-LS) or 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90 (JPEG 2000 Image Compression, Lossless Only).
 
For reference, this has been fixed integrating with the latest version of Slicer. See BUG: Update Slicer to include fix related to GDCM predictor6 bug in JPEG by jcfr Pull Request #93 KitwareMedical/SlicerQReads GitHub
 
We used to have an option to enable and disable Conference Call or Listen in, on Outbound and Inbound Calls.
On Conference Call you were able to add a user to your call. On Listen in you were able to enter to a Call if the setting was enabled.
 
3 WAY CALL Fastcall uses a 3-way conference call to enable call transfer and Listen in. When using a conference call, the call is set up a bit differently. We had used hold music, or silence and not ringing for these calls. This conference setting can now be on/off for specific users. If you have users who do not need the 3-way call, it is now easy to turn this off.
 
Other recent add in Fastcall version 4.90 is **RINGTONE**. You can edit this on phone number (Fastcall settings). When inbound/outbound conference call is enabled, now you can update settings selecting listen to ringtone. Select this on country ringtone.
 
Before, when creating a group goal, all users used to cooperate and each call sums against one common goal. Now we have the possibility to select individually call goals so that the goal has to be fulfilled by each user in the group.
 
The integration of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is in the nascent stage and promises to achieve new optimums in operational excellence. This study aims to empirically examine the enablers, barriers, benefits and application of I4.0 technologies in LSS and I4.0 integration.
 
A pilot survey was chosen as an appropriate methodology, as LSS and I4.0 integration is still budding. The survey targeted senior quality management professionals, quality managers, team leaders, LSS Black Belts and operations managers to collect the relevant research data. The questionnaire was sent to 200 respondents and received 53 valid responses.
 
One of the limitations of this study is the sample size. LSS and I4.0 are emerging concepts; hence, obtaining a larger sample size is difficult. In addition, the study used non-parametric tests to analyse the data. Therefore, future studies should be conducted with large sample sizes across different continents and countries to understand differences in the key findings.
 
The outcomes of this study can be useful for organisational managers to understand the enablers and barriers before integrating LSS and I4.0 for adoption in their organisations. Secondly, it helps to convince top management and human resource personnel by providing a list of benefits of LSS and I4.0 integration. Finally, it can help decision-makers understand which I4.0 technologies can be used in different stages of LSS methodology.
