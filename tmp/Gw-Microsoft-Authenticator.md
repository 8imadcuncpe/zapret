The Microsoft Authenticator app provides another level of security to your Microsoft Entra work or school account or your Microsoft account and is available for Android and iOS. With the Microsoft Authenticator app, users can authenticate in a passwordless way during sign-in, or another verification option during self-service password reset (SSPR) or multifactor authentication events.
 
You can now apply passkeys for user authentication. Users can then receive a notification through their mobile app for approving or denying the Authenticator app to generate an OATH verification code. This code can then be entered in a sign-in interface. If you enable both a notification and verification code, users who register the Authenticator app can use either method to verify their identity using passkeys.

Passkeys in the Authenticator app are device-bound to ensure that they never leave the device they were created on. On an iOS device, Authenticator uses the Secure Enclave to create the passkey. On Android, we create the passkey in the Secure Element on devices that support it, or fall back to the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
 
Passkeys in Authenticator aren't backed up and can't be restored on a new device. To create passkeys on a new device, use the passkey on an older device, or use another authentication method to re-create the passkey.
 
Instead of seeing a prompt for a password after entering a username, users who enable phone sign-in from the Authenticator app sees a message to enter a number in their app. When the correct number is selected, the sign-in process is complete.
 
The Authenticator app can help prevent unauthorized access to accounts and stop fraudulent transactions by pushing a notification to your smartphone or tablet. Users view the notification, and if it's legitimate, select **Verify**. Otherwise, they can select **Deny**.
 
Starting in August, 2023, anomalous sign-ins don't generate notifications, similarly to how sign-ins from unfamiliar locations don't generate notifications. To approve an anomalous sign-in, users can open Microsoft Authenticator, or Authenticator Lite in a relevant companion app like Outlook. Then they can either pull down to refresh or tap **Refresh**, and approve the request.

In China, the Notification through mobile app method on Android devices doesn't work because as Google play services (including push notifications) are blocked in the region. However, iOS notifications do work. For Android devices, alternate authentication methods should be made available for those users.
 
The Authenticator app can be used as a software token to generate an OATH verification code. After entering your username and password, you enter the code provided by the Authenticator app into the sign-in interface. The verification code provides a second form of authentication.
 
Consistent with the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-63B, authenticators used by US government agencies are required to use FIPS 140 validated cryptography. This guideline helps US government agencies meet the requirements of Executive Order (EO) 14028. Additionally, this guideline helps other regulated industries such as healthcare organizations working with Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) meet their regulatory requirements.
 
FIPS 140 is a US government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in information technology products and systems. The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) maintains the testing against the FIPS 140 standard.
 
Beginning with version 6.6.8, Microsoft Authenticator for iOS uses the native Apple CoreCrypto module for FIPS validated cryptography on Apple iOS FIPS 140 compliant devices. All Microsoft Entra authentications using phishing-resistant device-bound passkeys, push multifactor authentications (MFA), passwordless phone sign-in (PSI), and time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP) use the FIPS cryptography.
 
In new updates from the previous version of this article: Microsoft Authenticator isn't yet FIPS 140 compliant on Android. Microsoft Authenticator on Android is currently pending FIPS compliance certification to support our customers that may require FIPS validated cryptography.
 
Users can access My Security info (see the URLs in the next section) or by selecting Security info from MyAccount to manage and add more Microsoft Authenticator registrations. Specific icons are used to differentiate whether the Microsoft Authenticator registration is passwordless phone sign-in or MFA.
 
Microsoft continuously updates Authenticator to maintain a high level of security. To ensure that your users are getting the best experience possible, we recommend having them continuously update their Authenticator App. In the case of critical security updates, app versions that aren't up to date may cease to work and may block users from completing their authentications. If a user is using a version of the app that is not supported, they will be prompted to upgrade to the latest version before being able to proceed with authentications.
 
As long as you load the secret key for the specific authenticator, you can load the same authenticator to multiple Microsoft Accounts through the Microsoft Authenticator application. For example, I have loaded the same TOTP authenticator to (Authy, WinAuth, Google, Battle.net, Lastpass Authenticator, and Microsoft Authenticator). **All I needed to do was provide the secret code each application.** I have synchronized more than a dozen authenticators across every single device that I use. Since 1Password supports TOTP, I have also synchronized them there.
 
You would have to use a different TOTP authenticator, more than likely, unless the bank allows you to provide your own secret code instead of telling you what the secret code will be. However, you could have synchronized your authenticators to any number of devices. That is the only reason I feel comfortable using them.
 
I tried the authenticator app once but found financial institution 2FA text authentications to be completely adequate. But if you use the Authenticator it can be used on two accounts. Refer also to my comments above about two people, but if they share credentials you can probably do this.
 
Visit the Apple app store or Google play store on your device and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. Alternatively, the authenticator application can be downloaded directly to your desktop using the Microsoft Authenticator Website or by scanning the QR code with your phone.
 
Using the camera on your phone, scan the QR Code in the application and test the push notification flow as part of this experience. Additional written instructions can be found on the Microsoft website.
 
**Congratulations!** You are now setup with the Microsoft Authenticator app and can receive push notifications for multi-factor authentication verification. If you have additional questions please watch the step by step video instructions below.
 
I would like to know the possibility for integrating Google and Microsoft authenticator application for MFA in AUth0. Is it possible? If then it would be great if someone can provide the documentation for the same.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a great way to help prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account in the event your Chapman University account password is compromised. Chapman University's 2FA program uses the Microsoft Authenticator app which is available for Android and iOS devices.
 
BEFORE approving any unprompted 2FA alerts, please use the "My Sign-Ins" checker tool. Simply click the "My Sign-Ins" button below to log into your 2FA account. Once logged in, you will be able to see when and where the authorization request(s) came from.
 
The self-enrollment process only takes a few minutes to complete. **However, you must complete the enrollment process once you start**. Incomplete enrollment may cause your Chapman account to be locked until the enrollment process is completed.
 
**Mobile Email Note:** After your enrollment process is complete, your Chapman University account will be signed out of all Microsoft services, which includes mobile email access. You will be required to sign back into your email and authenticate the sign-in via the Authenticator app or six-digit code sent via text message. We strongly recommend that users to download and use the mobile Outlook app.
 
**Android & Apple Mail App Users:** If you are using the native mail app (Android mail or Apple mail) to access your mobile email, you will need to remove and re-add your Chapman Email account in your phone's system settings (similar to when you are setting up your email on a new phone).
 
After registering your account on 2FA, Microsoft will automatically sign your Chapman University account out of all services, including mobile email. If your are using the native mail apps (Android mail or Apple mail) on your mobile device, you will need to remove and re-add your Chapman inbox in your device system settings.
 
In the event that need to replace you mobile phone, you will need to re-add the authenticator app to the new phone. Even if you had all of you apps and data successfully transferred over, the authenticator app notifications may not work. If this is the case, follow the steps below and your authenticator app will be up and running in no time.
