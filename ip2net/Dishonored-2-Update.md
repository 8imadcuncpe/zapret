A dishonored check is a check payment returned by the bank to Florida Atlantic University, unpaid, for any reason. Stopping payment on a check is considered the same as a dishonored check. When a check is dishonored, students will automatically receive notification through their FAU email on file and a letter will also be sent to the student via mail to their local address. Effective October 24, 2023, check payments returned for Invalid Account Number, Insufficient Funds or Stop Payment, will be assessed a service charge fee based on the chart below:
 
**PLEASE NOTE:**

Students with dishonored checks or students who are paying for a dishonored check have 15 days from receipt of notice to tender payment to Florida Atlantic University to pay the full amount of the dishonored check.
 
Include copies of any papers that prove your claim. DMV will research your claim and contact you with the outcome. You may also call the Revenue Services Support Unit at (916) 657-8101 for additional information.
 
Once your payment is processed and returned by the bank, DMV will automatically send you a Demand for Payment letter and will be unable to stop the dishonored check or refund in error from occurring. However, if you are able to pay your fees (with another payment method) before your vehicle registration expires, you may be able to avoid penalties. The dishonored check or refund in error service fee will still be due.
 
If you have received a Demand for Payment letter, and full payment was submitted within the last 30 days, please disregard the letter. The Demand for Payment letters are printed in advance and do not reflect recent payments.
 
During the online transaction using your bank information for payment, the department advises customers that if DMV cannot deduct the payment from your account for any reason, a service fee will be charged. If the payment is for vehicle registration, you will also be subject to late registration payment penalties.
