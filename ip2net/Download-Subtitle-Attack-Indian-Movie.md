**DR. MOHAMMED IHSAN, Kurdish Human Rights Minister:** *[subtitles]*Some 8,000 Barzani Kurds were taken from 4 government camps in Kurdistan. I think my main role is to find out where these people are. I am looking for an answer for it.
 
**FIRST BARZANI WOMAN:** *[subtitles]*6 members of my family are missing. My 5 sons and my husband. My husband's name is Marku. My sons are Othman, Abdullah, Karim, Awni and Aziz. Othman was the oldest.
 
**SECOND BARZANI WOMAN:** *[subtitles]* My husband was a practicing Muslim. He didn't drink, smoke, nor do anything bad. He was good with his family. He was educated and quiet. If someone is good, quiet and handsome, isn't that enough? What else could a woman want? What else can I say?
 
**THIRD BARZANI WOMAN:** *[subtitles]* Sadeq was very good. There was nothing wrong with him. He was perfect. The other one, Taha was very kind to his children. When he got back from work, he used to hug and kiss me. The other one was the same.
 
**DR. IHSAN:** This is in September 1983. These Kurds were summoned by Saddam to listen to his speech. Really, this was broadcast all over Iraq and recorded off-air at the time. It establishes Saddam's guilt beyond doubt.
 
**SADDAM HUSSEIN:** *[subtitles]* The Barzanis spread their treachery to other families. They are involved in this crime and became guides for the Persian Army and helped them occupy Iraqi land. Some, who were called Barzanis, cooperated with them. So, they've been severely punished and have gone to hell.
 
**DR. IHSAN:** Here is the most dangerous part of our journey really. Between Hamrin to Khalas. One day I myself been attacked here by roughly about six terrorist cars. They attacked us. They find that we are well defended, well prepared. They run away. Just here.
 
**DR. IHSAN:** I don't agree with that approach. We should face it. We should study it. We should tell the truth to the people. This is Iraq and this is how Iraqis behave in the past. We should tell the truth. This is the truth. This is what we did. This is what all, the majority of Iraqis, involved in.
 
**DR. IHSAN:** You know this film has been leaked to the market by Iraqi intelligence, by Iraqi Mukhbarat, really. I think this is the way they are selling their terror to people, and reminding them that 'We are still here and this is the way we did it.'
 
**DR. IHSAN:** Really, we get some important documents today regarding the case of our Barzanis. For example, this one. It is a very critical one, really. It establishes a direct link between Saddam Hussein and the murder of 8,000 Barzanis. This document is dated 24 August, 1987, and the topic of this document is Barzani families.
 
**YOUNG MAN:** *[subtitles]* It was very hot in Nugra Salman. There was a football goal with two metal bars. My uncle was tied to the bars all day. In the evening they brought him back to the hall. The bars had scorched his back. This was one form of torture, and there were certainly other worse forms we did not see.
 
**OLD MAN:** *[subtitles]* Some 1,000 out of 11,000 people here died. Those still alive were taken away and just disappeared. I saw a long blue bus taking away the young men. It returned empty 30-45 minutes later, and did it again. That is a fact.
 
**HAJI JABBAR, Shia Shopkeeper:** *[subtitles]* On the day they moved the prisoners, a security officer came, knocked on the door and came into my store. He took a piece of cloth and some rope from me.
 
**DR. IHSAN:** Most of the information we have so far is second hand information. Because none of the informer himself dare to stand up and tell that this is what happened. Because most of them were taking part of it. The majority of them were part of the regime, and they were working for the regime at that time through police department, through customs, through border guards.
 
**DR. IHSAN:** I think this is concrete evidence that this belonged to the Barzani Kurds because this is what they wear on all days. Even today they are wearing the same clothes. The name is Shalu Shapiq.
 
**SPOSITO**: *[subtitles]* First of all, I would like to explain something. For you to wipe it from your minds once and for all. Nobody is going to take you off the lands that you occupy. These lands belong to the Cinta Larga.
 
Finding a survivor of the massacre willing to speak on camera was difficult. Many miners hope to mine diamonds on the reservation again, and they fear retribution from the Cinta Larga if they speak about what they saw.
 
**CHIEF SPOSITO:** *[subtitles]* This issue of the Indians and the miners is a war of the miserable. They are just people who are trying to survive, earning a little money to survive, while the cartels are taking advantage of that war. So miners die, Indians die, while the ones benefiting are those negotiating, speculating on the diamond market.
