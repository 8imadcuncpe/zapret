It is intended to serve existing and future customers with large power needs. There are three components to the Bay Corridor Transmission and Distribution project. The contracts are Design-Build (DB) in which SFPUC staff creates the fundamental design and the contractor completes the design and builds the project. Construction began in Fall 2020 and continues through 2024.

Equipment and materials will be temporarily located in your neighborhood during construction (mostly on side streets). Once construction is completed, material and equipment will be removed within 1 to 2 weeks.
 
Parking will be restricted during construction hours. We apologize for this inconvenience and assure you parking will be restored as soon as possible. Please see posted barricade signs for exact work days, hours, locations, as they may vary depending on construction task.
 
The asphalt paving applied daily is temporary and designed to provide a safe road surface during construction. Final paving will occur after pipeline work is completed. It may take up to 30 days or longer before final paving is complete.

Work hours are 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. We will provide traffic control, but residents may experience delays up to ten minutes when entering and leaving the work area. If you have special needs, please call us and we will make every effort to accommodate you.

Electricity is a necessary requirement for accelerating the economic development of any country and is considered an important input to improve quality of life. Overall, the electricity demand has far outgrown the supply, leading to load curtailment and increased dependence on imports from India in recent times. The peak suppressed demand in Nepal in FY20132014 has been around 1,200 megawatt (MW) as against installed capacity of 787 MW, hence resulting in a deficit of about 440 MW due to non-availability of generation. Government has plans to generate additional 10,000 MW in the next 10 years. About 63% of the population in Nepal has access to electricity but the supply quality is unreliable and inadequate. The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place.

The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place. In this regard, the need for immediate distribution network enhancement is included in the government's action plan to address energy crisis and provide universal access to reliable and efficient electricity for all by 2030. This will contribute in promoting sustainable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal #7) and Nepal's Intended Nationally Determined Commitments for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
 

ADB's Nepal country partnership strategy 20132017 supports the government's development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth. It seeks to address the infrastructure bottlenecks in the key areas such as energy services and creating an enabling environment for increased business and employment opportunities. ADB's support for the energy sector in Nepal has largely focused on generation and transmission with some distribution extension. This project will be ADB's first investment in Nepal specifically targeting energy efficiency through distribution system enhancements measures.
 
Package A-1-Supply and Installation of 220kV Lapisiphedi Substation and 132kV Changunarayan Substation: Work is ongoing in all locations except for Lapsiphedi, which is disrupted due to construction from the local community. Works at Teku and Siuchatar is expected to complete by December 2022. NEA is discussing with the affected local communities of Lapsiphedi to resolve the issue and start physical works as early as possible.
 
Package A2: Supply and Installation 132kV GIS Substations at Kathmandu Valley: Work ongoing in Phutung and Thimi Substation. Work could not be initiated in the third location- Chovar due to obstruction from local communities. Works were earlier delayed for Phutung and Thimi Substation due to poor performance of the contractor, however, it is rectified after regular follow-up from NEA and it is expected to be complete by June 2023. Physical works at Chovar is also expected to commence by August 2022.
