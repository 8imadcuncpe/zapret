They strive to reduce friction at every step so the minimum interaction cost or the effort required to consume content remains low. Fonts help in this mission by making messaging more visible, easier to read, understand, and also trust.
 
The Aesthetics of Reading researchers, at MIT, found that typography influenced comprehension. Participants who received good typography also performed better on cognitive tasks as well as on subjective duration. This is why the right font selection matters. The right font can help draw a reader in, encourage them to stay on the page longer, and nudge them towards a successful purchase.

While there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to choosing the best font for your business, your choices can influence your brand, so keep in mind a few design principles while arriving at the right set of options.
 
Fonts convey a hierarchy of information to customers helping them quickly scan product pages to decide which information is likely of most importance to them. Subtle variations in font size, weight, style, and typeface can communicate a shop flow so users become intuitively familiar with your site hierarchy and offerings. Your font choices should aid efficient decision making on a product page, thus nudge the customer towards a purchase.
 
Think about how legible your text will be on a desktop monitor, a tablet, and a smartphone. Keep in mind that your font must be web and mobile compatible so it does not look too cumbersome, or take too long to read while scrolling on a smartphone. A good rule of thumb would be to test your font on various devices and opt for simplicity in favor of distractingly decorative fonts. Font color also matters.

A lookup is a collection of commands that provide a text layout program with atransformation to apply on the input glyph stream. A lookup might specify how toform ligatures or how to do kerning, or any of a number of other things.
 
There are two major classes of lookups, those that reside in the GSUB table andsubstitute one glyph (or several) with another (ligatures) and those which livein the GPOS table and position one glyph relative to another (kerning).
 
The order in which the lookups and subtables appear in this dialog is important.This is the same order in which they will be applied. All lookups in the GSUBtable will be applied before any lookups in the GPOS table.
 
There are buttons on the side for reordering the lookups. Up, Down, Top, Bottomshould be obvious. You can also drag and drop lookups to reorder them. The[Sort] button will sort lookups depending on the canonical order of thefeatures attached to them. This will not always be the desired ordering, but itis a place to start.
 
Lookups are applied in the order listed here. Which lookups will be applieddepends on the script, language, and what features have been enabled (this willbe controlled by the text layout engine, and perhaps ultimately by the user).
 
Suppose for example that you have a kerning class, and a few kerning pairs. Ifyou put both of these into one lookup, with the kerning pairs in the firstsubtable and the kerning class in the second, then if a kerning pair matches theinput stream the kerning class will not be applied (so you can have specialcases that override the data in the kerning class).
 
The script dialog allows you to enter scripts and languages. Again you may editthese directly or press on the little rectangles to get a list of friendlynames. If you choose to bring up the language dialog you may choose more thanone language in it (use the control key to make disjoint selections).
 
After you have created a lookup you may add subtables to it. In most cases youwill only need to create one subtable, but for contextual or kerning lookups youmay need two or more (the second would contain a set of kerning classes, whilethe first would contain any special cases).
 
The [Add Subtable] button will prompt you to name th
