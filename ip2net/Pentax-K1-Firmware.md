3. Use either a USB cable from computer to camera, or a memory card reader connected to your computer, to transfer the firmware file onto your memory card. It should be in the root directory of the card, not in any folder. It should be the actual firmware file, not the whole zip file you downloaded.
 
6. Do nothing at all with the camera for the next couple of minutes while the camera completes the update. You will see progress bars on the view screen. Don't get restless and touch any buttons or controls. Most of all don't bump the power switch!
 
7. It will not explicitly say "Finished" (at least I don't remember it doing so) -- the final progress bar just completes and you are left with the red light twinkling at lower right. At this point you can turn off the camera. If you want to check that the installation was complete you can turn on again while holding Menu down with the memory card out (or after formatting it or deleting the firmware file).
 
With the EOS R1, Canon's flagship EOS-1 line of cameras finally makes the leap to mirrorless technology. Find out how the R1 compares to its predecessors and what new features it offers professional photographers.
 
The Pentax 17 is the first Pentax film camera in two decades. It's built around a half-frame film format and includes design cues inspired by previous Pentax models. Is the experience worth the price of admission? We tested it to find out.
 
What's the best camera for travel? Good travel cameras should be small, versatile, and offer good image quality. In this buying guide we've rounded-up several great cameras for travel and recommended the best.

If you want a compact camera that produces great quality photos without the hassle of changing lenses, there are plenty of choices available for every budget. Read on to find out which portable enthusiast compacts are our favorites.
 
Star AF allows the camera to automatically focus on stars at night. Normally, Pentax says, when focusing on astronomical photography, photographers would first focus on a star that is easy to focus on and then adjust it to the composition they want to shoot. With Star AF, photographers are able to decide the composition they want to shoot from the beginning and then focus by simply operating the AF on the camera. This mode is only available in live-view and when using autofocus lenses. It also can fail if there are too many bright objects in the area of the photo, such as could be caused by light pollution, or when stars are not visible to the naked eye.
 
Finally, Astronomical Image Processing allows photographers to adjust photos of astronomical objects in-camera and includes features like shading correction, fog correction, the darkness of the background, star brightness, celestial clarity, and fringe corrections. This applies to RAW or JPEG images. Below is an example of what can be expected from this feature:
 
Ricoh Imaging Americas confirmed that the premium firmware features for the Pentax K-1 and Pentax K-1 Mark II will eventually be available to US customers, although an exact timeline was not provided.
 
The new V2.41 firmware corrects a number of problems in the two Pentax cameras caused by December's V2.40 update: image recording failure when combining Astrotracer Type 3 with interval shooting; erroneous LCD panel indication of full memory cards; incorrect display of remaining shots in the viewfinder; and inconsistent exposure countdowns on the LCD panel when using Astrotracer Type 3.
 
Kalum's photography has been published and exhibited around the world, and he continues to photograph on a project-by-project basis. He is currently working on a personal project capturing the people and landscape of Gower, South Wales. Currently untitled, this body of work will be exhibited for the National Trust later this year.
 
Regular Firmware Friday readers will have known this was on the way after our earlier mention of a beta test, but now it's here in final, release-ready form. The Leica M10 firmware version 1.7.4.0 update is aimed at greatly expanding SD card compatibility. Where the previous firmware wouldn't recognize certain SD cards, or wouldn't always take advantage of their full performance, the new firmware now aims to do so better than in the past.
 
Unfortunately, the company doesn't mention any specific cards which should now be compatible, however it does note that cars from one to 512GB in capacity are supported, with a recommended minimum write speed of 80MB/s or higher. And of course, UHS II cards are still only supported in UHS-1 fallback mode, thereby sacrificing their performance advantage.
 
Moving along to Nikon, the company has updated its distortion control data for a huge raft of cameras, allowing for pincushion and barrel-distortion correction right in the camera body. The Distortion Control Data Version 2.016 update supports a total of 24 different DSLR camera models, although to use it you'll need to be running on recent firmware (albeit, not necessarily the latest-available version in all cases.) Courtesy of Nikon, the required firmware versions for each camera can be found below:
 
Among the camera manufacturers, this week Ricoh is the only one to offer new features to its customers. Specifically, through its new firmware version 1.30 update, Ricoh's Pentax 645Z medium-format DSLR has been gifted the same Outdoor View and Night Vision LCD modes as seen in other recent Pentax-branded DSLRs. Outdoor View mode allows significantly greater display brightness for sunlight visibility, as well as significantly lower brightness when shooting in low light. Night Vision mode, meanwhile, disables all but the red channel, even when in menus or reviewing images. The red channel has minimal impact on your night vision, making this function ideal for astrophotography or other extreme low-light situations where you need to ensure your night vision isn't disrupted.
 
Moving on to equipment other than standalone cameras, drone maker DJI recently updated its just-launched DJI Spark drone to firmware version 01.00.0400, and its controller to firmware version 01.00.0100. Courtesy of the official release notes, changes are as follows:
 
For increased safety, the flight is restricted to a height of 30 m and distance of 50 m when not connected or logged into the app during flight, including DJI GO 4 and all apps compatible with DJI aircraft.
 
Metabones has updated its firmware for several distinct series of products this week. The big news, though, is for its EF-E Smart Adapter MARK IV/V and EF-E Speed Booster ULTRA, which are now running firmware version 0.57. Here, there are a dozen or so changes as follows below:
 
Added autofocus support during high speed and medium speed continuous drive (up to 10fps) on Sony A9 ("Green" mode only). Experiment with the "Priority Set in AF-C" setting for the best compromise between hit rate and frame rate for your shooting style. Overall performance depends on lens used. The camera does not use hunting while tracking is in operation. If subject movement exceeds the measurement range of the OSPDAF sensor, autofocus pauses. This is by design. The measurement range of the OSPDAF sensor decreases as the focal length increases. Except for the original Mark I Smart Adapter this feature is available for all subsequent Speed Boosters and Smart Adapters.
 
There is an AF accuracy issue when using AF-S or DMF on Sony A9 and telephoto lenses with Metabones in "Advanced" mode, which affects this and all previous firmware versions. Green mode, which is set by default on Sony A9, is not affected (except for the original Smart Adapter Mark I, which does not support "Green" mode). A9 users are advised to not use "Advanced" mode but stick with the default "Green" mode. In addition, some telephoto lenses rarely exhibit this issue, such as EF 200/2.8L II USM, EF 400/5.6L USM and Tamron 150-600/5-6.3 VC USD A011. Investigation of this issue is still in progress.
 
And finally, for the Canon EF - Sony FZ CINE Smart Adapter, there is just one change: Auto iris, servo zoom, and custom function button support for the Canon CN-E 18-80 T4.4L lens. You can download Metabones' latest firmware at the links below:
 
And finally for this week, we come to Nissin. The Japanese flash manufacturer has updated its i40, i60A and Di700A flash strobes, as well as its Air 1 Commander device, to provide High-Speed Sync capability for Fujifilm cameras. You won't be able to install the updates yourself, however. Instead, you'll need to fill in the repair and service form, and send your gear to Nissin's US-market importer, New England Imaging Distribution. The update service is free of charge for products purchased from authorized dealers in the USA, and return shipping within the USA is also covered.
 
Las nuevas (ya no tanto) **tarjetas de memoria SDHC** (SD Hight Capacity), que recordemos son tarjetas con alta capacidad de almacenamiento y velocidad ya tienen un buen hueco en el mercado.
 
A las cmaras que ya vienen preparadas para este tipo de productos, que son casi todas las nuevas que salen al mercado, se unen de vez en cuando algunas veteranas por medio de actualizaciones de firmware. Es lo que ha ocurrido con los modelos de las firmas Pentax y Canon, que han hecho compatibles las ranuras SD de varios modelos con el estndar SDHC. Los modelos actualizados son las seis SLR de Pentax (todas excepto la K10D) y las EOS-1D
