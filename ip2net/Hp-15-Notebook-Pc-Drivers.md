I would LOVE to know why I cannot update my HP drivers for my HP laptop via the HP site as I used to do! Updating through Windows is NOT reliable as I have experienced in the past. On a previous occasion, my laptop was overheating and the fan kicked on and stayed on...even when the computer was not in use (lid closed, laptop in "sleep mode". I clicked on "Check for Updates" in Windows, which indicated I was up-to-date. Yet, when I ran HP Hardware Diagnostics, turns out there was a component that was not being recognized after an update and the system fixed the issue, the fan stopped running and the computer cooled down and problem resolved.
 
Now I cannot run an updated version of Diagnostics (in or out of Windows) because I continually get the "The version you have is outdated..." and to follow a link to the HP site for the latest version. I downloaded the latest version, which claims to operate with Windows 11, only to have this latest version not execute on my laptop. This is INSANE! Now I'm expected to jump through hoops and/or "hunt down" drivers elsewhere and hope I'm getting the latest (and CORRECT) components to care for my laptop, since I obviously cannot rely on Windows?! Had I known this was going to be a problem, I would have NEVER updated to Windows 11!
 
I shouldn't have to be "bothered" with this. My laptop is now having the same issue - after yet another Windows update, it's running warm after a short time in use, and the fan is kicking on and revs up to high speed (as it's supposed to do) because the laptop gets hotter. I shut it off in fear that it will overheat and become damaged. I've checked for updated drivers via all suggestions. What shall I do? My laptop is still under warranty. Shall I send it in and let HP deal with the issue? Or should I really inconvenience myself by reset the system back to its factory settings and reinstall Windows 10?
 
I neglected to include another issue that I've been having ever since "upgrading" to Win11 (more like downgrading quality-wise w/all the problems). My screen goes black unexpectedly. The first time it will be for 5 - 10 seconds, during which time I begin pressing the ESC key (sometimes the keyboard is also affected, sometimes not...it's very random). The screen will reappear, then will go black again mere seconds later. It will continue to do this, with shorter and shorter intervals until the screen just stays black. The sound is just fine, it continues whether the screen is black or not. I tried adjusting the power settings, as someone suggested, however this had no effect at all.

A post from Feb/2022 stated the same problem. The replier mentioned that the computers came w/Win10 preinstalled and asked if the poster have the issue before upgrading to Win11. There was no reply. Well, regarding my particular situation, the answer would be a resounding no. I did not have this issue w/Win10...at all...ever. I was in the midst of a video course and could not proceed due to the screen disappearing every few seconds and not responding to the keyboard.
 
Well, it looks like I AM going to have to revert to Win10 (aye yi yi, this will be a significant inconvenience). I looked into your suggestion re the possibility of using the display driver from the other model you mentioned, but the type of display is diff than the one I have. I believe the driver vers for Diagnostics is either older or the same as what I have. My other drivers are currently running without w/out problems..
 
I LOVE my laptop...you have to practically lay your head on the keyboard to hear whether or not it's on, and when it IS running warm (which is VERY seldom unless the atmosphere), the sound of the fan, in low speed really isn't worth complaining about. I am just very sensitive to the issue due to previous Envys overheating to the point of potential destruction (even the keyboard would become hot to the touch).
 
Fortunately, as mentioned in my initial post, Diagnostics fixed the problem. Hence my concern that presently I can only run what is now an outdated vers of UEFI...esp since the problem didn't occur until after the Win 11 instillation.
 
I've had HP's since 2008, so I am really disappointed when I come across silly problems as those I'm experiencing now and cannot be fixed due to lack of drivers. And to discover we're expected to rely on Windows for updates or other sources is outright ridiculous. I wholeheartedly agree, they should have drivers by now. My display issue is driving me nuts.
 
It's amazing and fantastic your Dell and HP notebooks from 2008-2013 are running smoothly on Win 11. And Vista, too... Normally, I don't upgrade unless I absolutely have to (I'm from the school of thought that "If it ain't broke, don' fix it"), but this time I ignored my instinct, thinking I'd have to do it sooner or later. I figured by now they'd worked all the "kinks" out and there shouldn't be any problems.
 
Thanks so much. Unfortunately, I was not able to take advantage of the drivers from the model suggested. I see no other choice by to revert back to Win 10...something I am not looking forward to due to the major inconvenience. I appreciate the well-wishes, though.
 
Last week, I purchased an HP 15-da0012dx notebook. I plan on making a clean installation of my OS, Windows 10 Home 64-bit v1803. However, I presume I am going to need to manually install my notebook's drivers. Where can I get a complete set of correct drivers?
 
When I do a clean reload of Windows 10 onto a new HP laptop I always back up the C:\swsetup folder and keep it on a thumb drive just for a safety net. But after you have installed Windows and made sure your network connection is working (Windows 10 does not fail to install a working network driver very often) the first thing to install is HP Support Assistant. Run it and let it pick up any missing drivers. It is not 100% effective but well over 90%. After that, look at device manager for any completely missing drivers. Look at the hardware you have and then go to the HP Home driver page for your laptop and look for recent releases and make sure they are installed.

I carefully cross-referenced drivers installed from Windows Update and HP Support Assistant with those listed on my product's page. To answer (4) in the OP, drivers indicated for Kaby Lake were always selected. Some drivers and software listed on my product's page were not installed, but to the best of my understanding, these were not pre-installed on my notebook (installed in my factory state) nor seem needed or desired. There were some drivers installed by Windows Update that were not on my product's page: two Intel "System" drivers, an Intel SCSI driver, a sound driver, and a Synaptics driver. However, I am not concerned by their installation.
 
My Wifi adapter suddenly disappeared after a restart. Now it does not appear in the device manager. There is no trace of a Wifi adapter whatsoever left in my laptop. All of this happened over night when the laptop was in shutdown state. I tried installing drivers but even that did not work. I tried to run Ubuntu on a USB to check and found no trace of a Wifi adapter even on Ubuntu. Ethernet works fine but keeps refreshing itself every 10-15 minutes. I've tried restarting the system several times and that is not working. Please suggest a solution to this problem.
 
Thanks for the response. I've disabled power saving mode for the LAN port but unfortunately, it did not solve the problem. Can you provide a link to the long forum post that you have mentioned in your reply? Any other help is most welcome. It has really become frustrating for me. Another point is that my laptop is not an old one. To be accurate, it is 1yr, 3months old. Is there any way to check if the hardware itself got damaged because I've almost exhausted all the other options.
 

Thank you for posting your query, I'll be more than glad to help you.

I understand that you are facing issues with your HP Notebook PC wherein the wi-fi adapter suddenly disappeared after a restart.
 
I continue to look thru the posts on this forum to see if anybody is making progress on the recent wireless connectivity issue and I just saw this:

the only way to fix it on the as of now new a6 7310 notebook is as follows- TYPE "device manager" into windows (10) search bar- SCROLL to "network adapters"-SELECT "realtek rtl8723be''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' wifi adapter" (which is the route cause of the problem)-RIGHT CLICK and "update drivers" use the internet to find and auto install option and thats it.

You are welcome to try that and see what improvement you see and post back on the forum
 
As I have already mentioned, there is no Wifi adapter in the list of available network adapters. It disappeared after a restart as mentioned earlier. Please try to provide the solution to the problem. I have also tried the HP Support Assistant app troubleshooting and that does not help the cause at all.
