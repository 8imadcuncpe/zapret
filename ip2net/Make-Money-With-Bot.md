It seems that only a very small percentage, perhaps only 0.001% or less, can generate income from 1000 chats. I believe that even with 5K chats, it would still be difficult to earn money. (Monthly traffic of 5K visitors from adsense only results in a small amount of income. )

driving users to your own site, and doing some sort of monetization or lead gen from your gpt - this works against 1. because you would want as many suers as possible on your GPT, anyone using it for free would be a potential customer in this case.
 
Nothing is lost, this is an investment, because we have paid a ticket to go on the boat pushing oars with the promise of earning something in the future. Only a few will do it, very few, the rest of us are just helping to feed and improve the AI and some are not aware of this. The three million gpt are just that, rowers in a boat improving the system, now a gpt in the middle of three million gpts has no advantage over the best that is promoted with programming and effective advertising, all this involves money, investment, marketing. The point is simple, here we are all working for OpenAI with the promise that at some point we can make a profit, unfortunately many, many are not going to make it.
 
As an example, we conducted a survey of an anchor spread for a fish farm. We where able to inspect 10 anchors @ 70m depth in one workday. Normally this would either have taken several days or not have been done at all.
 
We also recently carried out a pre-lay survey for a new cooling water pipeline for a gas company. This would normally require expensive survey vessels with multibeam sonars and divers. Because it was shallow water we could do the job from a 40 foot motor yacht at a fraction of the price.

And last Sunday we conducted an expedition collecting environmental data with our EnviroSense IO board and sensors, which is to be correlated with data collected from a satellite passing over our head at the same time.
 
All these jobs are paid jobs. Our goal is not to make money on providing services ,but rather as a proof of concept, hoping to convince these companies to buy our ROVs, but, we have charged a decent price for each job which is sort of getting me into the idea of providing inspections as a service.
 
My suggestion would be to look in your area, see where divers are used, check what they are charging, and there is your benchmark. Or maybe even team up with a diving contractor: you can do the inspection with the ROV, they do the intervention (if any).
 
Also, having redundancy on the job is a huge plus, because many times the ROV part is not the most expensive part of the project for the client. Having to abort a job due to ROV malfunction never looks great, so if you can invest in 2 vehicles and bring both then that is a good piece of mind for yourself and the client.
 
We come from the commercial UAV aerial industry, having grown out of hobby to commercial over the last number of years and there are many parallels between how the UAV market has evolved and what BR is doing for ROVs. It totally changes the market with making access to systems cheaper and easier. As such it changes the market a great deal. It makes entry into existing uses easier but also opens areas that before never thought of ROV use due to the limited available systems and pricing.
 
Also it is often better to work for free than to work at a reduced rate. Once a client has a number in their head it can be hard to up it later. It is hard to charge them increasing rates for ongoing work once a level is established. Doing a one of demo or test for free can sometimes get around that, allowing you to prove capabilities but not locking into a rate structure. Again though balance how much free work you do as everyone wants free over paid if they can get it.
 
Doing projects for non-profit groups or schools/research can be a good way to develop skills and show capabilities as well when getting paid is not an option. At least then the work is goign towards projects that have little to no budget anyway so not as bad as given away free work on commercial projects. Possibly try local river/wildlife organizations, environmental groups, etc. This work can make for good local PR.
 
This is an article we wrote a few years ago on starting a UAV business, while not all applies to ROVs there are some similar points to consider that might be helpful to those new to starting their own business:
 
Finding another company you can partner with can also be an approach, such as fisheries, inspection, survey or engineering firms that have the client base and technical skills but may not be involved in ROVs. Can be a potential way to get into a new market where you provide a service in partnership with someone already in the general field. We do similar on the aerial side where we work with another geomatics company for certain jobs where technical analysis of the imagery is required for volumetric and other type data review.
 
Very good points brought up by Roy above. Teaming is imperative, it is very difficult to be the ROV guy only, I am speaking from my over 20 years as a ROV/submersible pilot. Also, focus on the deliverable, your post processing of your data, that is what sells your company. As a side note pertaining to the money, not sure if anyone has mentioned this, but look into potable water storage tank inspections as well. I know of several companies that make a killing doing those. and that is all they do. Hope this helps.
 
We use the BlueROV2 as our primary underwater platform, and equip with our own sensor suit to get the data quality that we need to make accurate assessment out of. At the end of the day, providing an in-depth data-driven assessment is what the clients value us for over other ROV operators. To enable this, we put a lot of focus on the data analysis and also have a team of civil engineers who generated comprehensive client end reports.
 
There are many factors you can use, GPT conversations, forum members, OAI Staff members. One of the most popular GPTs has 400,000+ conversations. Most of the time people have one conversation with a GPT get bored then never use it again.
 
I hope you can agree with my primary point, being that revenue share will not be the main source of income for successful creators, but rather the integration with other services that will require separate subscriptions/micropayments.
 
The way how one can use a GPT to earn some income in a way that matches their business model, is exactly dependent on what the business is.
Personally I believe a freemium model is a good enough suggestion for many builders. But then we have to talk about the actual implementation of such a approach, which is doable but requires additional development.
 
Freemium is nice if you think users will want to go beyond it, be it with more usage or more features. It is also only feasible if either your cost of acquisition and free runs is low or if you have the financial backing and conversion rates that justify the free service just to get a percentage of those as paying customers eventually.
 
So, freemium models may need to become more restrictive than in the past, and at the same time increase their conversion rates. There will be some winners, but less and further between than in other 2-sided marketplaces.
 
Thus if we drive new paying customers to their site, or if the paying customers return to use our GPTs then we potentially have a win-win situation.
This model would be similar to YouTube for example where content creators get paid to keep viewers on the platform.
 
From there we have to ask where the money to be shared will be coming from.
Obviously there is only a limited amount of Plus money to be distributed. Looking at YouTube we know how they fight to keep the platform profitable with many ads and without add blockers and extra transactions on top.
 
First of all, consider why you want to make money with street photography. Do you want to make money with street photography because you want to make it a full-time living? Do you think that only doing things with street photography will bring you happiness? Or do you just want some extra side-cash from doing your passion, which is street photography?
 
For example, I teach street photography workshops for a living, and as of now (2017) am making a pretty sizable passive income with Haptic Industries (tools for street photographers, led by my partner, Cindy).
 
I know a lot of street photographers being contacted via social media, by including their email addresses in their biographies. And some of them get contacted by companies, to do marketing or advertising campaigns.
 
For myself personally, because I have blogged heavily on street photography, many people find this blog through Google searches, read my articles, books, and watch my YouTube videos, end up trusting me, and signing up for one of my workshops, or purchasing one of my photo books or camera straps.
 
Similarly, you want to make sure to have good work. I have faith in my street photos, my insight and teaching abilities, as well as my blogging abilities. Your skills will improve over time. So make it a point to put out the best quality product you can, in terms of your street photos, your blog posts on street photography, your street photography books, or any street-photography-related products or services.
 
For example, I get annoyed on social media when people share too many photos, too frequently. I personally like to share my photos, but less regularly, and only my best work. Of course, I fall victim to over-sharing like everybody, but just remember the golden rule:
 
I've enjoyed recording samples and playing with audio as a hobby for quite a while now. Recently I purchased a zoom h2 and the quality of the recordin
